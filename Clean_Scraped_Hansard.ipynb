      "[['Mr Sitoh Yih Pin', 'Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum allocated for Head X of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\" Sir, MCCY shoulders the heavy responsibility in safeguarding the social compact that we have assiduously built in Singapore over the years – the unwavering belief and determination to work together to build towards a collective future regardless of race, language, culture or religion. This social compact amongst Singaporeans forms the bedrock that has enabled us to overcome many challenges faced in nation building over the years. Our unity and strength in diversity is a unique part of our social fabric that is vital to the survival and progress of Singapore. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis brought out the very best of our Singapore community. We have seen the bravery and sacrifices of our frontline teams and heard of anecdotal stories of neighbours and friends within communities caring for and reaching out to one another in these challenging times. But, Sir, on the other hand, as a result of the pandemic, we have also observed the polarisation of some societies along the lines of socio-economic status, race and nationality. Despite our strong social compact, Singapore has not been spared. We have seen racist incidents, vocal discussions on the treatment of low-wage workers and attitudes towards foreigners. Some of the incidents gained widespread publicity amplified through social media and other online platforms. Such issues are highly emotive in nature and can easily serve to divide us if not carefully managed. It is a timely reminder that we cannot take social harmony in Singapore for granted. Sir, I do believe, however, that the current discourse over race and religion as well as foreigners and jobs can be useful if discussed in a constructive and respectful manner. It can also prompt a deeper reflection about our values and what it means to be Singaporean. We must, however, exercise ample deliberation in managing the discourse. We must remember that we did not build the social compact we have where we enjoy racial and religious harmony overnight and it certainly did not happen by chance. It took generations of effort, understanding, compromise and reaching out to grow the common spaces we share in order to attain what we have. It is a precious commodity that we must not freely give up. Sir, as we move towards the future, we can expect these issues to continue to be discussed. In the TODAY Youth Survey published in November last year, it is clear that our youths are progressively seized with and are inclined to speak their minds on issues such as race and religion. Our demographic is also slowly moving in a different direction. Over the past 10 years, approximately one in five marriages have been between couples with different ethnicity and/or race. With this trend, it will mean that there will be a whole segment of the next generation of Singaporeans born of these marriages who will also join in the discussions of race and religion but from a wholly different perspective. We are therefore likely to grow into a more diverse society in the future and while that will mean that more voices will need to be heard, it will hopefully make us a more robust, culturally richer and enduring society. I therefore invite the Minister to share MCCY\\'s strategies to ensure that Singapore remains a caring and inclusive society where we care for one another, where everyone\\'s voices are heard and where our shared beliefs unite and drive us as a nation in the years to come.

Organisations and agencies have adopted a collaborative attitude to achieve better outcomes for the people. However, there are still residents in rental units facing multigenerational issues, and this hinders their aspirations to achieve a better life. Last year, the Government launched Project Dian@ M3 in Geylang Serai, Bedok and Jalan Besar. What are the best practices learnt in terms of volunteer engagement and data sharing that has led to better collaboration among agencies in helping families living in rental units? How can we coordinate and work more closely with Malay/Muslim organisations that are actively helping the residents in order to avoid duplication of efforts?

More often than not, these offenders are the sole breadwinner like the father, husband or son. Incarceration is something that can impact the institution of family. Although the offender was the one being incarcerated, his family members are also affected. Usually, the assistance or support given to the offender's family only comes at the beginning or the end of the offender's sentence. If we look at it, usually at the beginning of the offender's sentence, the offender's family may not feel desperate for daily needs. However, as time goes by, the offenders' families may feel trapped and depressed. If we are not careful, other family members can be affected too. Efforts such as reintegration support for offenders and families should be stepped up. I would like to ask how many families have been helped by FITRAH? Can FITRAH monitor and identify any multi-generation problem in the family, and how does FITRAH help those families? Are there plans to coordinate efforts and assistance for the family, not only at the beginning or the end of the prison sentence, but also for the entire incarceration period so that the families of the offenders are not neglected? More families are facing complex issues such as mental health and teenage pregnancies, and there is a need for FITRAH to mobilise volunteers to help these families, and so, how can the FITRAH structure be strengthened for the long term so that this effort can continue?\"], ['Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin', \"When I was given the opportunity to serve in MENDAKI's Committee on The Future Economy, we surveyed our students to understand how we can support their aspirations and ensure that they have a place and role in the future economy.

While family advice is important, our young people in this generation are growing up in a different era and economy where job and education opportunities are very much different compared to 20 years ago. I would like to ask whether the Government employs a strategic approach to support the students' capability and development, and increase opportunities for them to obtain scholarships to enhance their skills in new growth areas?

We should be proud that the Malay community, through its awareness, determination, drive, effort and hard work, have managed to excel. During this period, we see many more young Malay/Muslims excel in higher education. However, to achieve further success, we have to look at the gaps and challenges before us and try to find solutions for each one. The Malay community is known for its \"gotong royong\" spirit. They are good at uniting their efforts. Nonetheless, as the world is changing rapidly, we also need to learn from others to gain new knowledge and skills to overcome the current challenges. As the Malay proverb goes, whenever it floods, the shoreline changes shape (when a major change takes place, everything else will change too). So, while many people may be happy to just swim in a small pond, the Malay community now aspires to swim in the ocean. However, there is also another proverb cautioning us that if our fishing line is short, do not test the ocean (if we do not have the capacity, do not attempt something beyond our capabilities). A rapidly changing world has impacted our stability and traditional sources of income. Careers that used to provide stable employment are now facing challenges and becoming scarce. These careers have been replaced by new forms of jobs that changes quickly and this requires us to be nimble and adaptable to ensure a stable income. Our workforce is challenged by stiff competition from foreign workers flooding into our country, hungry for job opportunities that are increasingly becoming scarce in their own countries. Mr Chairman, in terms of monthly income, the Malay community is lagging behind. The 2020 Population Census showed that the average monthly household income from work was $6,851 in 2020 and the median level was $5,704 which is the lowest compared to the Chinese, Indian and other communities, and furthermore, 37.1% of Malays are living in 3-room, 2-room and 1-room flats. Sir, although I would like to touch on a number of things in this speech, due to time constraints, I will focus on one basic and important aspect in achieving progress and development in any society, which is education. Organization tasked to address this challenge must ensure that it has made appropriate and sufficient preparations. Hence, improvements must take a two-pronged approach. First, by identifying jobs that will provide the most opportunities for our community right now and in the future. Second, by identifying the community\\'s inclinations and strengths so that any necessary preparations and adaptations can take place now in order to prepare us for a work environment that has changed and will change in the future. All this will certainly influence the focus of our education in the future. A focus on education that prepares our children in navigating future challenges must be emphasised. Forward thinking education should be the basis of their curriculum and any exposure that they have to undergo should be future-realistic. We also need to find new ways to help Malay students excel in innovation and creativity, in Islamic finance which is being increasingly accepted in the global market including fintech, pharmaceuticals, robotics with its sophisticated use of nanotechnology and green technology, which is the basis of the new and future economy. For these new fields, we also need the expertise of religious scholars to enlighten the community on matters that require our involvement. As such, I would like to ask the Minister-in-charge for Muslim Affairs the following questions. Firstly, what are the Government\\'s plans to enable more young Malays to enter these new fields by 2025? I hope that the Minister and MENDAKI will share this plan so that the Malay community knows the direction they need to take in this rapidly changing world. I would also like to ask what are MUIS\\' plans to equip our asatizah with the knowledge and expertise in the areas of fintech, pharmaceuticals, robotics and green technology? The community needs to know if there are any asatizah leadership who are knowledgeable in these fields and at the same time, able to delve deeper into Islamic jurisprudence and syariah issues. I would also like to know how the Malay community can learn from the current asatizah who are experts in these issues. Mr Chairman, our young Malays are increasingly getting excellent results in the O and A-level examinations as well as in their studies at the local universities. These include madrasah students who obtained distinctions despite being burdened with a much higher number of subjects compared to their peers in secular schools. This shows that there are young Malays with huge potential who needs to be given the full attention, assistance and support. Besides the increase in the number of Malay students in local universities, there is also a growing number of young Malays who are furthering their studies at the Bachelor\\'s degree or postgraduate level in foreign universities. In future, with the world changing rapidly and new fields of knowledge being created, there will be more Malay students who may want to gain knowledge and experience in institutions of higher learning overseas. I hope MENDAKI can enhance its overseas study loan scheme in terms of the loan quantum and also by including many more new fields. This is to ensure that our Malay students\\' ambitions and aspirations are not hindered due to financial matters. On this regard, I have some questions for the Minister. Over the past 10 years, firstly, how many Malay students have received assistance through the overseas Study Loan Scheme provided by MENDAKI every year? Second, how many of these students who received assistance had their loan scheme converted into scholarships due to their excellent results? Third, what is the average loan amount given out by MENDAKI every year? Fourth, how many postgraduate students did MENDAKI assist over the last 10 years so that they can take their Master\\'s and PhD in overseas universities? And finally, what is the average loan amount channeled to overseas graduate students every year? Going forward, the Malay community would like to know clearly whether there is a masterplan by MENDAKI to propel the Malay community forward in line with the demands of IR 4.0. Sir, at the beginning of my speech, I spoke about achieving progress in both religious and secular fields. I shared my views on how we can further strengthen efforts to continue our progress by expanding educational fields and knowledge to keep up with the changing times. Before I end my speech, I would like to touch on current developments that we must pay attention to, especially by Muslims in Singapore. Sir, the Muslim community\\'s progress does not depend solely on the development and improvements in education. It also depends on efforts to do good, and at the same time, endeavor to help Muslims follow Islamic values more closely. Last January, the Singapore Islamic Scholars and Religious Teachers Association (PERGAS) issued a statement via social media platforms Facebook and Instagram that they will form a task force on the issue of LGBT or Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals and Transgenders in Singapore. Some of the plans made by PERGAS include a dialogue with members of the LGBT community who are Muslims, and efforts to help and guide Muslims in Singapore in facing and addressing the LGBT issue together. Sir, in this regard, I would like to state that I am fully appreciative of this effort by PERGAS and I will certainly support any effort that takes a positive and enlightened approach in discussing and navigating the LGBT issue. Thank you, Sir.'], ['Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim', \"Chairman, in last year's Committee of Supply debates, I asked about the KelasMateMatika or KMM programme and I was pleased that KMM had successfully prepared students for primary school.

A KMM participant in Chua Chu Kang told me that the programme gives her confidence when teaching Mathematics to her child. This is encouraging because many parents participating in the programme come from low-income families and may not be highly educated. What is the latest update on the achievements of the KSS and KMM programmes and to what extent has the ECDA-led KidStart programme been able to complement the KSS and KMM programmes for Malay/Muslim families?

An Advisory Panel has been set up to review the necessary steps for the wakaf. In March last year, following my Parliamentary Question on WMS, we were informed that the Advisory Panel has submitted its recommendations and Minister Masagos Zulkifli also explained that apart from the submitted recommendations, the Government also needs to study various other aspects to refine the general approach on wakaf. And this includes considering proposed amendments to existing laws. The last wakaf was made more than 40 years ago – in 1978. Here, I agree that we need to restore the spirit and culture of endowing property for the benefit of society and nation, as those before us had done in the past, which helped established many of our religious institutions and welfare bodies through wakaf. To achieve this objective, I had proposed in my previous Parliamentary speech that we need to establish a holistic eco-system including a more comprehensive dispute resolution framework and a public awareness campaign on estate planning. Our community needs to be prepared for a rainy day. I hope WMS can trigger a positive change in our community. Therefore, can the Minister provide an update on the establishment of WMS and its plans moving forward to further encourage the practice of wakaf in Singapore? Can the Government also consider setting up a dedicated department in the Syariah Court or MUIS to hear any disputes related to the issue of Muslim inheritance, including wakaf?

MUIS later explained that wakif's wishes are being respected and that the broader intention has been fulfilled. As such, I would also like to know what MUIS' efforts are in educating the public regarding wakaf and whether input is being sought with the community on how the wakaf assets are being used. This is because believe that by doing so, it would put the Muslim community's mind at ease and may encourage the community to contribute further to the fund.

The Lembaga Biasiswa Kenangan Maulud (LBKM), which has many institutional MMO members, could also galvanise community efforts in relation to education upliftment.

May I ask what the programme is doing to groom the asatizah to fill the different leadership positions not just in religious institutions but in the adjacent sectors as well? The religious knowledge asatizahs have is important in providing expertise and guidance in non-religious sectors as well, benefiting not just the Muslim community but the wider community as well.

How are the salaries benchmarked against relevant sectors and what is the pay progression like as they upskill and upgrade? At the same time, how are we galvanising the community to support this pay progression as well? Lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic saw the need for our religious teachers to quickly pivot and adapt to ensure that religious classes and programmes could still be carried out to benefit the Muslim community. I would like to commend them for their efforts.

We could perhaps wrap in a sharing on mid-career switch to lawyering, which can reach the applicants as well as their children who accompanied them. Second, we can encourage our Malay/Muslim workers, especially the younger ones, to be adaptable and to try new things.

But we were not deterred. To ensure our survival, the Government’s priority was to ensure access to affordable education, housing and healthcare. This became the bedrock for us to build strong families and caring communities. Even after more than five decades, our Singapore story continues to centre around a shared vision of a society that provides opportunities for all, regardless of race, language or religion. We were united and worked as one to uplift the lives of Singaporeans, including our Malay/Muslim community. The Census of Population 2020 has shown significant progress in education and household income for the Malay community when compared with ten years ago. More Malay workers were also employed in fast-growing sectors such as Information and Communications, as well as Financial and Insurance Services. I am heartened by this progress as it reflects the good progress of our education and employment outcomes over the decades. In the past few years, I have spoken about the three \"C\"s that make us a Community of Success – character, competence and citizenry. This year, I will focus on the development of our competencies, even as we build on our achievements to propel the community towards further success. This will be done through three key strategies. Firstly, reinforcing the network of care through M3; second, partnering the community and industry in building a competent workforce; and third, shaping a competent religious sector. While our economic progress has benefited many Singaporeans, it has also given rise to new challenges, particularly towards the vulnerable. Rising social inequality has become a common concern for many advanced economies. Such situations make it easy for new fault lines to emerge between different segments of society and threaten our social cohesion. In Singapore, we can avoid such situation if we continue to ensure that social mobility remains alive. Therefore, for the vulnerable segments of our community, the Government and the community must continue to work hand-in-hand to ensure that they are well supported through the different life milestones. For example, the Government has rolled out several initiatives, such as support measures for early childhood education to better prepare our young for the future – this is the best way to ensure social mobility. For our community, these have been further amplified with community initiatives by the M3 agencies – namely MUIS, MENDAKI and MESRA – as well as those undertaken by other Malay/Muslim organisations, to further amplify support those in need. Minister Maliki will share our plans on how M3 reinforces our network of care for our community and families, as we empower and engage this segment of our community to achieve their aspirations. This year, Yayasan MENDAKI is celebrating its 40th anniversary. Some of us would have remembered then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s speech at the opening of the Mendaki Congress at the Singapore Conference Hall in 1982, where he called for MENDAKI to raise the educational levels and thus the living standards of the community. I am pleased that MENDAKI had applied his advice over the past 40 years. In working closely with its partners, MENDAKI had contributed to the very encouraging progress shown by the Malay/Muslim community. Over the past four decades, the proportion of Malay university graduates increased multifold – from only four graduates in 1980 to almost 110 graduates in 2020, for every 1,000 Malays. Better education outcomes had also led to better career opportunities. The proportion of Malay PMETs has increased, from 7.2% in 1980 to 39% in 2020. This is more than five times! Congratulations! But we cannot be satisfied now and end our journey here, especially when we are faced with stiffer global competition and even more rapid changes in technology. Senior Minister of State Zaqy will elaborate on MENDAKI’s efforts to expand support beyond the classroom to offer more strategic programmes, in fulfilling the evolving needs of our community. These efforts stress the need to imbue a culture of lifelong learning in our community, especially through upskilling, so that we remain relevant in the new economy. Mr Chairman, in English, please.'], ['The Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)', \"Chairman, as we speak of building relevant competencies for the new economy, we will also nurture future-ready asatizah, our religious leaders, who are capable and confident in providing sound religious in an ever changing global landscape contextualised to Singapore's multi-religious, multiracial society. I will elaborate on MUIS plans to shape a credible and resilient religious sector in the final speech of this segment.\"], ['The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad)', 'Mr Chairman, Singapore’s progress is built upon a shared purpose and a sense of togetherness. The Malay/Muslim community aspires to be a Community of Success – to contribute to the growth of our nation and create opportunities to uplift our families and those around us. Skilling, reskilling and upskilling are vital to succeed in the future, especially in this economy, as we look beyond COVID-19. The Government, in partnership with the industry and the community, is ramping up its efforts to better position our Malay community for employment in growth sectors while inculcating lifelong learning into our DNA. We will focus on upstream support by strengthening mentoring and early career guidance for youths in schools. This year, we have several new initiatives for our students in the ITE. We will also enhance scholarship opportunities and financial support to help students pursue their aspirations. For those that have entered the workforce, we will partner industries to provide upskilling and direct emplacement opportunities for workers, especially in growth sectors. Mr Chairman, each child deserves an opportunity in life to actualise their potential. However, there may be times when they face challenges which weigh heavy on them, causing some to lose motivation and hope. Thus, having a support system is critical to motivate them to stay resilient and keep on the right path to fulfil their aspirations as well as their potential. This is why MENDAKI is investing and strengthening its mentoring programmes. We believe that our youths can benefit from a mentor outside the classroom – a role model whom they can turn to for advice, look up to and learn from to realise their aspirations. At the same time, we want to provide opportunities for those who have succeeded, to give back to the community. Ms Mariam Jaafar and Mr Sharael Taha asked for an update on MENDAKI’s mentoring programmes. I am happy to report that, as of last year, the M3 Youth Mentoring Office (YMO) has matched over 1,000 mentors to more than 4,000 mentees across various mentoring programmes. The YMO will continue to expand the mentoring ecosystem and will be engaging a further 600 mentors and 2,000 mentees this year. We are also glad to share that 10 community partners from the Community Leaders Forum (CLF), including the Majulah Community, Malay Youth Literary Association (4PM), AMP Singapore and Singapore Tenkasi, have come on board to conduct mentoring programmes for their own beneficiaries. With the YMO, we are now making mentoring more accessible for all. I call on more from the community to step forward as mentors to help our youths thrive as successful adults. To address Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin’s query, mentoring programmes from MENDAKI and M3 Focus Area 3 partners are opened to all Malay/Muslim students, including madrasah students. In fact, these programmes aim to expand the social circle and promote bonding among students from the various backgrounds. We have been taking this inclusive approach for other MENDAKI programmes, too, such as the Future Ready initiatives and career programmes, which are designed to prepare our youths for meaningful careers, no matter their background. Mr Abdul Samad asked about the students in our Institutes of Higher Learning. In 2021, there were 5,000 Malay graduates from ITE, 3,200 from the Polytechnics and 800 from the Autonomous Universities (AUs). On average, about 30 Malay graduates from each ITE cohort progressed to the Autonomous Universities. You can imagine the pathways and I think it is quite commendable. According to the latest Graduate Employment Survey, among economically-active Malay graduates, about nine in 10 graduates from the Autonomous Universities and Polytechnics, and eight in 10 graduates from ITE were employed within six months of graduation. Their employment outcomes are broadly comparable to their peers from other ethnic groups. Chairman, this year, we will provide more support for our youths in ITE to complement the Government’s efforts to enhance applied education in Singapore. Piloted in 2019, MENDAKI’s Empowerment Programme at ITE seeks to build support systems and help students acquire life skills, develop confidence and grow their potential. To Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman’s question, the Empowerment Programme has benefited more than 2,000 mentees since its inception. Through the programme, MENDAKI has managed to enroll one in every five Malay/Muslim NITEC students in 2021. The programme has proven to be successful. Ninety-six percent of participants from the Empowerment Programme in 2021 remained in school and progressed to their second year. One student that benefited from the ITE Empowerment Programme is Muhammad Roth Isaac from ITE College West. Isaac took on a part-time job to help his family of four after his father’s income was affected by the pandemic. Even though Isaac is just a teenager, he had to deal with the pressure and responsibility of juggling school and supporting his family. Fortunately, he had a caring mentor, Mr Sandeep Krishna, who constantly checked on his well-being and helped him with his studies. Mr Sandeep currently works as a Network Engineer. Despite his heavy work commitment, he sets aside time for mentoring. Mr Sandeep recalls the challenges he faced as a student not too long ago and, hence, he believes in the value in guiding youth towards their potential. Mr Sandeep befriended Isaac and motivated him to remain in school. Isaac remained focused and managed to achieve a 3.7 GPA in his first year of NITEC. So, well done, Isaac, and thank you, Mr Sandeep! We need more like him. We need to help more students like Isaac to do well – not only for themselves, but for their families and the community. The ITE Empowerment Programme will be refreshed to the #amPowered@ITE programme, which will retain key elements of its predecessor, but enhanced to include a tiered mentoring approach where mentees will be assigned to programmes based on their unique needs. This means tailoring the mentoring approach for each mentee to achieve specific objectives depending on their circumstances. The #amPowered programme will also be progressively made available under the MENDAKI Tuition Scheme (MTS) and at our M3 Towns. We agree with Mohd Fahmi Aliman and Mr Sharael Taha that our students can benefit from structured career guidance, especially to growth sectors, such as information and communications, financial and insurance services, and professional services. Growth sectors. Thus, to complement the mentoring programmes, MENDAKI will deploy Care Advisors at each of the YouthSpaces in the three ITE Colleges. Their role is to guide students on possible education pathways and connect them to skilling or emplacement opportunities. Care Advisors can also be found at MENDAKI’s satellite centres to serve the Malay/Muslim community at large. Mr Chairman, over the years, MENDAKI has provided bursaries, study loans and subsidies so that financial circumstances do not impede our students from achieving success. Moving forward, MENDAKI will focus on providing targeted financial support on the developmental needs of our students and broaden the opportunities for them to build career aspirations. Mr Faisal Manap may be pleased to note that MENDAKI has been actively growing its industry partnerships to provide scholarships for our students to position them into growth sectors. This year, I am pleased to announce the launch of the GIC-MENDAKI Scholarship. Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, GIC, in collaboration with MENDAKI, will introduce a new undergraduate scholarship for Singaporean Malay students who are keen to pursue a career in the finance industry. The scholarship is in partnership with three local Universities – NUS, NTU and SMU – and will cover the undergraduate tuition fees for most degree programmes in these Universities. GIC will provide structured internships, job rotations, networking and mentorship for the scholarship recipients. So, they can expect an exciting and purposeful career with GIC upon their graduation. The GIC-MENDAKI Scholarship is the latest effort by MENDAKI to collaborate with the industry to provide a springboard for our youths into careers in fast-growing industries. This follows other scholarships, such as the MENDAKI-MiRXES scholarship formed last year in Life and Biomedical Sciences, and the SIA-MENDAKI scholarship. These scholarships provide students with priority internship opportunities and secure employment upon their graduation. MENDAKI will continue to expand these opportunities and I urge all Malay/Muslim students to work hard and seize them. The generosity of our corporate partners and community has enabled us to provide more support to deserving students. Since we set up the Education Trust Fund (ETF) in 2003, MENDAKI has disbursed over $30 million in financial assistance donated by the community to over 130,000 Muslim students. Last year, over $1 million of ETF bursaries was established, including the ETF-Gafoor PropNex Bursary and Math Coaching Fund. On top of school necessities, this bursary would directly pay for students’ development programmes in Mathematics. I hope this targeted approach will be the way forward for MENDAKI to better support the immediate needs of our students and their growth. I have explained how we intend to prepare our youths for the future. So, let me now elaborate on our plans to provide more directed and targeted support to emplace our Malay/Muslim workers into growth industries. Mr Chairman, in Malay, please.'], ['The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad)', 'Mr Chairman, I have explained how we intend to strengthen upstream mentoring and career guidance efforts to help our youth achieve their dreams. MENDAKI will also enhance financial support and scholarship opportunities to help students pursue their aspirations to succeed. For those in the workforce, we will build up their competencies so that they stay relevant for new and growing industries. Last year, MENDAKI conducted 15 career fairs, participated by over 700 job seekers. Out of these, more than 300 workers were placed in jobs. As part of MENDAKI’s transformation efforts, we will expand our partnerships with national training agencies to emplace our Malay/Muslim workers in growth industries, such as in technology and the green economy. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim and Mr Sharael Taha also asked how these efforts will benefit our new job seekers and mid-career workers. Mr Saktiandi Supaat also gave a few suggestions which we will study further. Do allow me to explain the Government’s approach in more detail. MENDAKI will build on our partnership with SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) to promote capability development programmes to the community. We will augment national efforts by mobilising MENDAKI’s Care Advisors at our five satellite centres. These Care Advisors will also be deployed at SSG career fairs held at the various M3@Towns. The aim is to increase awareness within the community about the activities and services offered by SSG as well as share information on Future Ready programmes. The community can look out for our Care Advisors at the employment fairs, to get the necessary advice. MENDAKI will also join forces with the National Trades Union Congress, NTUC, to help our Malay workers secure job placements in emerging and growth sectors. Besides offering various job development programmes, NTUC will link our workers to job opportunities and training at the workplace, to enable them to reskill and upskill themselves into hiring industries. The Government will continue our efforts to support Malay/Muslim workers to build up their competencies and enhance their employability. This includes strengthening the leadership core of our Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMO) through the Tunas Bersama M3 programme launched last year, and this will further enhance our collective efforts to ensure our community’s continued progress. More details on the Tunas Bersama M3 programme will be shared in the near future.'], ['The Senior Minister of State for Defence and Manpower (Mr Zaqy Mohamad)', 'Mr Chairman, the community has shown good progress in employment in the last 10 years and we aim to do even better in the years to come. As MENDAKI celebrates its 40th anniversary, it remains invested in the community’s success by looking at more strategic programmes to support our youths to pursue their aspirations and for our workers to strengthen their competencies in a dynamic workforce. Our growth has only been possible with the strong support of our community and our partners. So, let us all work together as one, keeping the community at the heart of what we are doing so that they, too, can do well for themselves and contribute back to society. This continuous cycle of support would go a long way in strengthening the competencies of our Community of Success.'], ['Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M', 'Mr Chairman, in Malay, please.'], ['Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M', 'Our asatizah are well-regarded within the community for their important role. In fact, there had been prominent religious scholars in Singapore, such as Ustaz Syed Ahmad Semait, Ustaz Syed Abdillah al-Jufri, and Ustaz Ahmad Sonhadji. They made significant contributions to the Islamic religious discourse in Singapore. The religious texts they produced are still being read and used as reference today. Many of my peers grew up with Ustaz Ahmad Sonhadji\\'s foundation text – Mari Sembahyang, or \"Let\\'s Pray\". We are fortunate to have our own local madrasahs that ensure a steady pipeline of asatizah talents. They are also familiar with our way of life within Singapore\\'s context. Since the curriculum review implemented over 20 years ago, madrasah students now are capable of pursuing either Islamic Studies at the higher education level or take up secular education. Mr Abdul Samad asked about the retention rate of students in the madrasah system. Every year, the madrasahs collectively enrol about 380 students at Primary 1. Within each cohort, about 50 students leave to join the national schools, either within the six years of primary school education, or after the PSLE. Among those who remain, about half will pursue post-secondary education in secular institutions. Today, about one in every four students who started their education in the madrasah graduate from the religious track and become asatizah. One in every four students. Based on the Asatizah Manpower Planning Study, this is almost sufficient. Indeed, we should be proud that our madrasah students have no problems switching to secular education. However, it should be emphasized that the main goal of madrasah education here is to produce new asatizah who can guide the Singapore Muslim community, and expand our asatizah sector, in addition to contributing to broader sectors should they wish to do so. For students who eventually become asatizah, they need to be able to provide sound religious advice. They need to understand the lived realities of the community here and be sensitive to the cultural nuances to guide the Muslim community in navigating new and complex challenges. In line with this year\\'s focus on enhancing competencies within our community, we will support the asatizah sector to acquire impactful competencies. This will be done through three strategies. First, we want to develop critical bodies of knowledge for the asatizah, so that they can be exposed to broader perspectives and worldviews. Second, we will enhance the career pathways for the religious sector, to ensure that this profession remains appealing and relevant. Third, we want to mobilise community resources to sustain the development of our religious sector. The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the need for our asatizah to be prepared to address complex issues in a contemporary society and unprecedented global challenges. In addition to acquiring deep knowledge of our religious traditions and having a strong character, our asatizah must also possess the competency to contextualize religious teachings to Singapore. This requires them to form a strong connection with our multiracial society, in order to better understand our experience of living in a country full of diversity. This is especially so because our experience as a Muslim-minority community is different from those of Muslim-majority societies. Therefore, I agree with Dr Wan Rizal that we need to develop bodies of knowledge that can guide Muslim-minority communities living in multireligious societies to navigate contemporary socio-religious issues more confidently, while enabling them to practice their faith with ease. On this front, we have rolled out several initiatives like the ISEAS-MUIS Masters Scholarship, the Research Programme in the Study of Muslim Communities of Success, as well as the Postgraduate Certificate in Islam in Contemporary Societies (PCICS). Mr Abdul Samad asked about efforts to help returning Islamic Studies graduates contextualise their knowledge for the local community. This is the aim of the PCICS, which provides returning students with the framework to apply their knowledge to the local context. One of the graduates who benefitted from the PCICS programme is Ustazah Sarah El Rani. She found the programme useful in deepening her understanding of Islamic traditions, such as the use of Maqasid Shariah in Islamic Jurisprudence to address new challenges faced by societies. This allowed her to better understand its application in the Singapore context, such as the adjustments made to religious practices as part of COVID-19 preventive measures. To address Dr Shahira\\'s query on support given to returning Islamic Studies graduates, our key focus is to ensure that these graduates contribute back to the Muslim religious sector in Singapore. The PCICS equips them with the knowledge to provide progressive religious guidance, while exposing them to critical skills and competencies that can also be applied in relevant non-religious sectors. MUIS will be organising the International Conference on Communities of Success (ICCOS) later this year. Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Dr Wan Rizal asked about the key objectives of this conference, and how it will benefit the Singapore Muslim community. Building on the two pre-conference seminars held last year, the upcoming conference will bring together religious scholars to develop critical bodies of knowledge that can guide Muslim-minority communities in multicultural societies. With the theme \"Contributing Citizens, Dynamic Institutions\", it will focus on how enlightened and contextualised religious guidance, coupled with institutional support, can empower Muslims to live as dignified citizens and contribute to the nation\\'s development. Delegates from various nations will be invited to share and learn from one another. For students who have done well in the madrasahs, I hope more of you will go into the religious sector and see the asatizah profession not merely as an employment opportunity, but as a meaningful and attractive calling. This is my hope for students who had done well in the A-Levels, the IB Diploma, as well as the Aliyah programmes. They are excellent candidates for the next generation of our future asatizah. We will continue to support these students in their education, including providing prestigious scholarships for the talented ones to further their studies. This is how we can ensure a strong leadership renewal in our religious institutions. For those that show potential, MUIS offers the Religious Leadership and Talent Development Programme, or RLTD. Presently, around 120 asatizah have benefited from the various initiatives within this programme. It provides participants opportunities to have fireside chats with community and religious figures, and benefit from mentoring programmes. Most participants found the programmes useful as part of their career development in the religious sector. This addresses the questions from Dr Wan Rizal and Mr Fahmi about plans to develop and groom asatizah leadership in Singapore. Under the RLTD as well, MUIS is introducing the Leadership Milestone Programme which provides formal training for asatizah with good potential. The objective is to further develop and groom them for future leadership roles. This comprises two key tracks. First is the general leadership track, where asatizah will benefit from a wide range of courses offered by various public and private institutions, to hone their competencies before they lead an organisation. This includes courses in financial management, strategy formulation and human capital management. Second is the religious leadership track. This seeks to deepen the asatizah\\'s knowledge and appreciation of our religious traditions and its application in the Singapore context. Under this track, the Leadership Executive Programme will provide a platform for asatizah to have discussions on the religious life of the Singapore Muslim community and gain a deeper understanding of policy issues. These initiatives will expose our asatizah to a wide range of issues, to help nurture their leadership potential and hone their critical thinking, especially on religious issues impacting our Muslim community. Ultimately, our aim is to prepare the younger generation of asatizah to be ready to serve when called to higher office, including helming our key religious institutions, such as the Mufti, the President of the Syariah Court and the Kadi at ROMM. Therefore, we need to structure clear and meaningful career pathways for the asatizah. This includes remuneration for the asatizah, as asked by Mr Abdul Samad and Dr Shahira. MUIS is reviewing the salary guidelines for the religious sector, especially for those working in the formal religious sector like mosques and madrasahs. We will need to ensure the sector is equally attractive as competing sectors. Details will be provided when the review is completed. We will also need to fund the long-term needs of our religious sector. This is why there are plans to encourage the wakaf culture within our community, as asked by Mr Zhulkarnain and Dr Shahira. Since the launch of Singapore Community Wakaf, an Advisory Panel was formed to get feedback from key stakeholders and put forth recommendations on how to galvanise community support in the implementation of this wakaf. This year, MUIS formed working groups, comprising MUIS officers and industry experts, to implement detailed action plans for the Singapore Community Wakaf. It will take into consideration the recommendations from the Advisory Panel Report that was submitted last year. This includes plans like engaging our institutions like the wakaf and mosques to pool our assets together and invest their reserves to grow the corpus fund; and second, encouraging the community\\'s participation through public education initiatives on wakaf, particularly on wealth and legacy planning. Mr Chairman, in English, please.'], ['Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M', 'Chairman, to further support the development of our young asatizah, MUIS is dedicating a campus for the PCICS programme, to be housed within the Wakaf Bencoolen complex. The new campus will include various learning facilities, including its own library, and is expected to be completed by end of this year. Initiatives such as the RLTD, PCICS and the International Conference on Communities of Success (ICCOS) are key enablers to propel the asatizah sector forward and we will need the community’s support to achieve its desired outcomes. The Singapore Community Wakaf will thus be crucial in catering for the long-term needs of the Muslim community. Chairman, in conclusion, my colleagues and I have spoken on three strategies to strengthen our competencies as a Community of Success. Underpinning these strategies are strong and resilient families, who provide a conducive environment for children to grow and achieve their fullest potential. Here, our community partners and institutions play an important role. Our Naib Kadis, for example, are key partners in supporting the work of building strong and resilient Muslim families, especially through the Bersamamu programme. In this regard, the M³ agencies will also partner MSF to commemorate the Year of Celebrating SG Families this year. Through these efforts, we will keep social mobility alive in Singapore, so that every Singaporean has a fair chance to succeed in life and contribute back to the society. In this regard, we will journey with our community every step of the way to propel them towards success.'], ['Mr Saktiandi Supaat', 'Chairman, I would like to thank Minister Masagos, Second Minister Maliki and Senior Minister of State Zaqy for answering my questions. I have two clarifications. First is in regards to the GIC-MENDAKI scholarship for Singaporean students, I really welcome the announcement. It is a good step in that direction. I need to seek further details on the scholarship. One, when will it be offered? How many recipients will be awarded the scholarship? What are the eligibility criteria? And would there be further expansion to possibly postgraduate scholarships because I mentioned that the SkillsFuture credit take-up is quite low, so the lifelong learning efforts in the community can be enhanced even further through postgraduate scholarships as well. My second clarification is with regards to the question in my cut. Our plans for sectoral-based approach to enhance our PMET representations in sectors which are growing as well as sectors that are growth industries as it is now, in the current. What are our plans for corporate scholarships and partnerships because of the points that I raised earlier about low PMET numbers and low SkillsFuture credits take-up rate.'], ['Mr Zaqy Mohamad', \"Sir, I thank the Member for his clarification. Thank you for seeking and acknowledging the hard work that MENDAKI put in to put some of our industry scholarships together. So, I am pleased that the GIC-MENDAKI scholarship has come about and we will announce more details in due course. Do keep watch for this, because I am quite sure it will excite quite number of prospective young graduates who are keen to join the financial sector. On postgraduate scholarships, generally, as a basis, if you look at where the Government is putting its resources today, we have made a lot of push with SkillsFuture to support individuals regardless of where they are to gain mastery of skills and master lifelong learning. It is not just about going for a master's degree or postgraduate, but there are also other skills training and certificates you can go for postgraduate. But even today, there are schemes like the SkillsFuture Mid-career Enhanced subsidy and the SkillsFuture Work-Study degree. You can also go for the Work-Study degree that is open to all eligible Singaporeans including the Malay/Muslim community. These are already available scholarships that that is provided across nationally. Where MENDAKI comes in, is really to augment the suite of existing financial assistance. But our intent, as Mr Saktiandi may note that we have already started with SIA, followed by MiRXES and now GIC, there is a certain trend that we are going to work towards to look for more like-minded corporate partners who could support move for our Malay community. One, to enhance and to provide them with the pathway into growth sectors, but also more importantly for them, it also helps to build diversity and a strong Singapore Core for the PMETs in the various companies. We hope to announce more in future, but you know, it is going to be hard work in the next coming months and years to make sure that we can expand this programme further.\"], ['Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim', 'Thank you, Chairman. I thank the Minister for the announcement on the update on the Singapore Community Wakaf. I think the bigger issue will be the general estate planning, future planning and retirement security of our community. So, I agree that public awareness is key. If I may ask, with the workgroup, will there be other efforts to be made to approach the community and engage the community through the community partners preferably through M3 and other Malay/Muslim organisations to tailor make the message. For example, just like \"Dadah Itu Haram\" campaign that is quite effective for the community. Secondly, what would be the framework of support that we would encourage the take-up of such strategies to plan for estate planning and wealth planning, including the recruitment of Wakaf and also the Lasting Power of Attorney. This could also include legislative amendments and the proposals that I suggested in terms of the Sharia court and Muis\\'s recommendations.'], ['Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M', \"I would like to thank the Member for the clarification question. For Wakaf Masyarakat Singapura (WMS), like the Member has pointed out, the last one was given almost 40 years ago. In fact, long more than 40 years ago. This culture of bequeathing your property to benefit yourself for your religious needs – but more importantly, to benefit society for the long term – is a culture that we have had for 1,400 years and we have had it in Singapore when Muslim Singaporeans had become wealthy during the early days of our colonisation. And in bequeathing this properties and actually in enhancing these properties alone, we have managed to accumulate something like almost $800 billion worth of assets. That is wonderful. Unfortunately, I would say there are some constraints in which the benefits of such bequeathed property and trust, constrain how it should be distributed. Sometimes, we have problems finding the village in a country that does not exist anymore or people whom we do not know whether they are still around to benefit from these assets and trusts. And therefore, in going forward, we have to look at how this problems do not get encountered again by us and future generation. I also want to find out that in formulating WMS, it is beyond just calling the community to bequeath their assets, it is also calling them to prepare their children to be well-endowed through education, career and also to build their own wealth, so that they do not rely on their parents' wealth to live on their life. And that the parents also do not feel guilty in giving away that wealth for the sake of the community, for the future of the community. We are in a good place and time right now, because as you have heard from many of our speeches just now, the community is at the inflexion point of being better and acquiring wealth for themselves and I am calling them, it is great that you are benefiting yourself and your children, just think about benefiting it for the community and for the future.\"], ['Dr Shahira Abdullah', 'Thank you, Chairman. I have a few clarifications. I note that we are going to have a salary review of the asatizahs and I also realised that it was announced somewhat in early 2020. May I know what is the rough timeline and when we can expect the results of the review since it was announced in 2020. Secondly, I would like to say that the PCICS is a wonderful initiative. From what I see from the recent news, they were given salary incentive of $100, but it was only offered to those working in mosque and madrasahs. May I know whether it will be extended or expanded to other asatizahs and whether these $100 is benchmarked against other sectors?'], ['Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M', \"Well, from ways we can only be in control of the sectors under our care and that has to do with our madrasahs and our mosques. I am very thankful that the mosque community, the madrasah community has responded without us making it compulsory or mandated through Muis's instructions. I call upon the other sectors to do the same – recognise our asatizahs, give them a meaningful salary scale, salary level, let them live a dignified life like everybody else, like the ones that we want for our own children. I believe our community is very, very generous. We have not pull ourselves back whenever we call for support for our friends in Palestine when calamity have befallen them. In fact, in many circumstances through the Rahmatan Lil Alamin Foundation (RLAF), when disasters happen around our area, we have been able to collect donations to help victims who are not Muslims, who do not live in Muslim countries, so we have also give regardless of race, language or religion. Therefore, for our asatizahs, we should be more generous and not hold back this amount. There is no benchmark in this, but over the long term, we hope that the review on the salaries tell us exactly where we are, what the gaps are, more importantly, how to get the funds to fund this gap, and here is where we will need to rely on the wealth and generosity of our own community to fund our own religious needs.\"], ['Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin', 'I like to thank Minister Masagos and Second Minister Maliki Osman. In Malay, please.'], ['Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin', \"I would like to come back to my two questions on FITRAH, that is, if M3 will collaborate with the Malay/Muslim organizations, ComLink and other agencies, are there plans to offer and coordinate support to the family of offenders? Not just at the beginning or the end of their incarceration period, but throughout the sentence so that the offender's family can emerge stronger? Second, as the FITRAH programme requires the commitment and support from a rather large number of volunteers, how will the FITRAH structure be strengthened for the long term? Thank you\"], ['Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman', 'Sir, I thank Ms Nadia for the supplementary question. She is absolutely right, when we work with families, like those under FITRAH, it is very complex. The structure of the families are very complex. Sometimes, you do have the father in prison, single mother having to do with very young children. Sometimes you have both parents who are in prison, incarcerated and children are under the care of grandparents, very complex. When we started FITRAH, it is really looking at many different dimensions, one is to ensure that the needs of the family members who are outside, supported primarily their children, because really, it is the stability of the children while the parents are incarcerated, is very critical. And stability comes in the form of ensuring that they are continuing to be able to go to school, they are able to get support for their social-emotional development and everything around that concept. And that is the first part of looking after the children – understand their social-emotional needs, even economic needs. At the same time, we ensure that work with the inmates continue. That is very important. And the reason why we put the framework in place is to give a very strong message to the inmates that it is a time for reflection and rehabilitation for you, too, so that when you do come out and get released, that you do make every attempt to turn over a new leaf. And this is very important because sometimes we do come across inmates who repeat the offences and they go back in and we want to make sure that FITRAH provides comprehensive support to prevent relapses amongst the inmates. On collaboration and coordination of different programmes, I assure Ms Nadia Samdin that we continue to do so. Part of the effort of helping FITRAH families will be the effort of UPLIFT, part of the effort will be under ComLink. So, the coordination effort is being worked on and, certainly, we agree that it is not just while the inmate is incarcerated, support must continue to be given even after they have been released so that they see stabilisation has been achieved while they are incarcerated. Yet, at the same time, we work towards independence and self-reliance moving forward for the incarcerated individual and their families.'], ['Ms Tin Pei Ling', 'Chairman, community harmony is important to engender a sense of collective and shared destiny. But this can be undermined at times by misunderstandings and disputes. During our constituency work, we would have come across a range of community disputes – noise from neighbour, noise from groups playing at the basketball court downstairs, cigarette smell, incessant high-rise littering, irresponsible feeding, encroachment of common space and the list goes on. In these disputes, one party may be puzzled about why does the other party not understand or comply with the implicit and explicit “rules”; the other party may think that there was nothing wrong with the behaviour and wonder why the complainant was making life difficult. Small disagreements, if left unresolved, can fester into ill-feelings and anti-social behaviours with long-lasting effects. Our community is diverse with people of different backgrounds. The idea of co-existence is important, though a delicate balance to strike. Community norms, therefore, play a critical role in keeping a certain order and harmony in the community. As time passes or as environment changes, norms could shift. The pandemic has forced us to stay home more. So, we face each other more and things that used to not bother us can become difficult to bear. So, we need to review, re-establish and/or revise the norms needed in the community. To do so, we need more dialogues and engagements but, most importantly, is that the community must come to a common understanding on the priorities and acceptable behaviours within the community. To this end, the Community Dispute Resolution Framework has been a useful and complementary tool to improve community dispute management. Therefore, I would like to ask, how will MCCY continue to enhance the framework to effectively manage community disputes and relations, while partnering Singaporeans to co-create and establish community norms in their own neighbourhoods?'], ['Mr Derrick Goh', 'Mr Chairman, one major lifestyle change arising from COVID-19 has been about more residents working or learning from home. Along with this trend, we are seeing a rise in the number of disputes within the community. For example, last year, HDB reported around 38,400 cases of noise-related feedback, a 25% increase from 2020, while the Community Dispute Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) also saw higher applications. When community disputes arise, grassroots volunteers and on-the-ground agencies, such as HDB, Town Council or Police, are often the first responders to help engage the parties. Those of us who have helped to mediate a dispute will know that they are never easy. With the number of conflicts between neighbours on the rise, our first responders will be strained with more cases. Given this, can the Minister share if MCCY will dedicate more resources, such as improving training for our first responders, to help our communities be more effective in managing such conflicts? The Community Mediation Centre (CMC) also plays an integral role in resolving neighbour disputes. Mediation at the CMC is an informal and voluntary process, conducted by professionally-trained mediators who are volunteers from all walks of life. Cases referred to the CMC have seen relative success. Can the Minister share more on CMC’s effectiveness and will the Government consider mandating mediation for community disputes? Lastly, a legal avenue for resolving disputes is the CDRT. My constituents gave feedback that those who have engaged with the CDRT have not found it to be easy, as they faced long battles which are often adversarial in nature, usually as a result of counter parties raising evidence or allegations haphazardly during proceedings. The process may, therefore, result in more friction and deteriorate relationships further. Therefore, it is important to ensure that parties engaging in the legal process will be able to ensure quick and effective justice at a lower cost.  Experts and businesses have said that this hybrid model of working and learning from home is here to stay, even if the pandemic ends. I look forward to the Minister’s plans on how the Government can strengthen existing solutions to counter the growth in community disputes so as to preserve our social cohesion and harmony.'], ['Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song', \"I would like to seek the Minister's update on the review of the community dispute management framework, which commenced before last year's COS. Can the Minister share who the members of the interagency committee conducting this review are and when the review will be completed? How many mediators does the Community Mediation Centre currently have and is this sufficient to manage their workload? I have met residents who have a vexing dispute with their neighbours, but are unwilling to let me refer them for mediation because they know their neighbour will not turn up for the session. Of the average of 735 cases per year registered at the CMC, 70% did not progress to mediation, mainly because one or both parties declined or did not respond to the invitation to mediate. To improve the take-up rate of mediation, could the Ministry consider these suggestions? First, once the CMC assesses a case to be suitable for mediation, can attendance of both parties be made compulsory? Second, if the dispute eventually goes to the Community Dispute Resolution Tribunal (CDRT), can the Tribunal be allowed to draw an adverse inference from their non-attendance? This potential penalty should be made clear to respondents when the invitation to CMC is served. Next, I have received feedback from residents about the difficulty they face in filing CDRT evidence. For example, they need to save their audio or video recordings on a CD-ROM or DVD. Most people nowadays do not have a CD-ROM burner in their home. Can the CDRT update its processes to allow evidence to be uploaded on the web portal instead and to make the whole process more user-friendly for the layman?\"], ['Mr Gan Thiam Poh', 'Madam, dispute among neighbours are becoming increasingly common. Unfortunately, a significant number take a long time to resolve due to the uncooperative neighbours, some of whom are openly and persistently flouting the law. These cases include harassment, obstruction of passageways, dangerous placement of objects, fire hazard and noise pollution. Would the Ministry consider setting up a dedicated team for mediation and enforcement and a hotline for residents to contact for issues relating to neighbour disputes?'], ['Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan', 'Madam, I wish to ask MCCY on how many Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) cases have been filed, heard, mediated and adjudicated on annually for the past five years. Also, what actions, if any, have our Courts or complainants taken when offending parties, even after the tribunal order, still continue to perpetrate and breach the order? I wish to also ask MCCY to share if there are plans to better ensure the more effective and efficient resolution of CDRT complaints as there are more situations of work from home and resulting in more neighbourly disputes and some of these disputes cannot be resolved via the voluntary mediation route via community mediation and whether such mediation, moving forward, can be made compulsory.'], ['Ms Joan Pereira', \"Madam, the COVID-19 pandemic ignited a spirit of gotong-royong in my division when the Bukit Merah View Market and Hawker Centre became a COVID-19 cluster last year. Many residents, community partners, religious organisations, private companies and strangers reached out to me and my community to volunteer and offer various forms of help, especially to my hawkers and the vulnerable in my division. It was very heartwarming and the community became even more closely-knit and resilient. With the pandemic placing restrictions on community events, which we used to organise in the past, we need to reorganise how we connect and strengthen ties among our neighbours. Building friendship and trust amongst our neighbours must still continue to be the focus. However, we know that disputes still occur. What we observe sometimes is that relationships become so bad that neighbours do not talk to each other and, in some cases, even dragging in other neighbours into the dispute, creating a non-harmonious living environment. I hope that MCCY can empower our grassroots volunteers and staff with relevant skillsets to mediate disputes between neighbours. It is best when things can be settled and nipped in the bud at the local level without further straining relationships. How will MCCY empower our grassroots leaders and staff to build on this spirit of care and continue to strengthen community life at the local neighbourhood? The mission of our Interracial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs) is ever more important today as we face sharper faultlines and greater challenges to our racial and religious harmony. When there is conflict, especially when it involves potentially sensitive racial or religious issues, we must quickly seek to resolve and nip the problem in the bud. We should not ignore it and hope for it to blow over, thereby allowing the problem to fester and blow up into a bigger problem. The best way, really, is through mediation, with trained personnel who have the necessary knowledge and skillsets for the problem at hand. With a mediator, whom all stakeholders can acknowledge and respect, the chances of resolving the problem is much higher. Would the Ministry elaborate on how it will bring disputing parties together to resolve such issues? We must also educate our people about customs of different races and religions so that we can be more mindful and avoid potentially offensive behaviour. We must be respectful of one another's differences and widen the common space. There are often complaints of noise disturbances or certain practices of religious or cultural events and festivities. As we approach the 20th anniversary of IRCCs in 2022, what are MCCY's plans to ensure that our IRCCs remain relevant and effective in maintaining racial and religious harmony and strengthening our social cohesion?\"], ['Miss Cheng Li Hui', \"Madam, over the past two years, we have weathered the challenges brought on by COVID-19, hand-in-hand, Government and people. As a result, we are in a much stronger position today even as we ride out the current Omicron wave and look forward to a better future. I was reminded of it recently during the Tampines East Edusave Ceremony when this lady said “Hi Miss Cheng, we finally meet”. It turns out that she is the chairlady of her company’s CSR and she had mobilised the team to help out in our mask-making during circuit breaker. We had only corresponded via emails and phone. I remembered then, Standard Chartered Bank also listed my email on their CSR portal and I would get dozens of emails daily asking “How can I help?” The logistics company, taxi driver, fabric supplier who helped, all declined payment. It was their way of contributing to fight the pandemic. Many would have also heard of neighbours helping one another with grocery purchase, mask and sanitiser collection, especially for their elderly neighbours. Our cohesiveness as a nation has strengthened over the pandemic years. Chairman, this cohesiveness among our people and the trust in the Government that we have in Singapore is precious. In many other parts of the world, we have seen how the pandemic had aggravated existing faultlines and even created tensions between the government and people, with anti-vaccination and anti-mask protests. These tensions made it more challenging to deal with the pandemic. Can the Ministry share how we can continue to build upon this spirit of care and strengthen community cohesiveness in Singapore? How can we make volunteerism and care a part of our lives and match like-minded people to the causes that they are interested in? Madam, religious and racial harmony is an important part of our social fabric. We are all aware of how racial riots rocked Singapore in the 1960s. Although many years have by gone, that period holds important lessons for us. From time to time, racist incidents happen and we are reminded that building a multiracial and multi-religious society is, indeed, a work in progress. Take, for example, last year, there was a viral video showing a confrontation between a man and an inter-racial couple. We may not have the full facts of what happened but many of us were rightly disturbed and worried after watching it. We must never waver in our commitment to promote harmony among our people. Therefore, the role of our IRCCs is even more important. When I was a young volunteer, I remember IRCCs organising excursions to Hindu temples, churches and we had buka puasa over nasi dulang in mosques and got to know each other's religion better. Unfortunately, IRCCs stopped having these programmes years ago. What are MCCY's plans to ensure the relevance of IRCC and its role in strengthening our social cohesion?\"], ['Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman', \"Yes. Madam, in 2020, MHA spotted a spike in race and religion-related Police cases. Last year, we heard about anecdotes where racial remarks were made against Singaporeans. For instance, an ex-Ngee Ann Polytechnic lecturer made unwelcomed remarks about an interracial couple last year, triggering a slew of responses from the public. The occurrence of such incidents has thus reminded us of the need to show the greatest tolerance and respect for one another. MCCY has also stepped up its efforts to tackle racism and racial discrimination in Singapore. In response to several Parliamentary Questions raised last year, MCCY mentioned it adopts a multi-pronged approach in combating racism and racial discrimination. MCCY's approach, namely, constitutes enforcement and legal framework, encouraging respectful online behaviour, encouraging conversations on the topics of race and religion as well as enlarging the common spaces. These four elements of MCCY's approach would be essential in ensuring that Singapore society remains resilient and cohesive as we transition to a post-pandemic future. Given MCCY's efforts to promoting social harmony in Singapore, can it provide an update on efforts to continue rallying Singaporeans to step up on integration efforts and build a more cohesive society? Moreover, can MCCY elaborate on its upcoming plans to step up on our social cohesion efforts and partner Singaporeans to bridge existing societal fault lines? The findings of the Individual Giving Survey by the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) in 2021 showed that regular volunteerism took a hit mainly due to its measures implemented to curb the spread of COVID-19, with nearly half of the volunteers saying that they have volunteered less since DORSCON Orange was alerted on 7 February 2020. NVPC polled more than 2,000 people between 8 April and 17 September 2021 for the study. They noted at 48% of volunteers volunteered less since DORSCON Orange was declared on 7 February 2020. On the other hand, the survey also showed that online giving rose during the COVID-19 pandemic despite an overall decline in volunteerism. Notably, online volunteering sign-ups in Singapore saw a 29% increase and online donation rose 37%, compared to pre-pandemic levels. In light of these findings, could MCCY share how it plans to leverage on the growth of online volunteerism and provide more opportunities for Singaporeans to step forward? Moreover, could MCCY also elaborate on its efforts to reframe the public's impression of volunteerism, often associated with labour-intensive work and perceived as separate from one's social or professional lives. Are there online efforts to make volunteerism and care a part of the Singaporean way of life? Could MCCY also share its plans to provide opportunities for Singaporeans to serve others using their skills and talent and galvanise like-minded people to work together on social and community causes that interest them? Finally, what is being done to better promote and match volunteers to the needs on the ground?\"], ['Prof Koh Lian Pin', \"Madam, our youths are our future. We should engage and encourage them to participate and contribute actively to matters of national concern that will impact our society in the long run. Over the years, MCCY has announced numerous initiatives, such as the Youth Action Challenge and digital engagements, to engage our youth and seek their views. Could the Ministry share its plans to provide even more opportunities for the civic participation of our youths from diverse backgrounds on topics of national interest, such as the review of our nationally determined contributions and other sustainability goals? Additionally, what are the Government's plans to support our youths in taking ground-up actions on social and environmental causes they are passionate about?\"], ['Mr Mark Chay', \"Mdm Chairman, I am aware that MCCY has been engaging citizens through different platforms, such as the Emerging Stronger Conversations, which was launched as part of the Singapore Together Movement in June 2020. There are also Conversations on Singapore Women's Development and OnePeople.sg. Creating these platforms is commendable and well-intentioned, with the goal of bringing Singaporeans to work with one another for a better future. Feedback is critical for growth and I would like to request that MCCY provide an update on the progress of these conversations. I am aware that these discussions typically span a wide range of topics, such as national identity, care for the elderly, technology, governance and so on. The impact of these dialogues would provide reliable insight into the state and progress of our nation in different areas. It is, therefore, important that MCCY answers the following questions: (a) how have these conversations translated to concrete and measurable action; and (b) how will MCCY continue to provide Singaporeans with opportunities to contribute ideas and work towards our vision of a caring, just and equal society? The world is changing in so many ways. What we do for entertainment today will be replaced by emerging ideas and innovations. The future of entertainment is firmly rooted in digitisation and technology. Netflix, for instance, has revolutionised the entertainment industry by giving customers original and high-quality on-demand content available to people regardless of location. Other platforms, such at Twitch and YouTube, take live content to hundreds of millions of viewers around the world. On the future of entertainment, I would like to discuss two points: first, the need for enabling technology and the metaverse; and second, the importance of adapting to hybrid and digital events. Mdm Chairman, entertainment platforms and opportunities will almost be exclusive to the Metaverse in the not-too-distant future. This will serve as the future for many things we are currently doing today. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), e-commerce and the integration of collectibles give the audience ownership of their fan experience. These will enhance interaction between users and their favorite teams. It would be highly beneficial to Singapore if the Ministry could encourage digital content and technologies to facilitate interaction between the real and virtual worlds. I would like the Ministry to consider a gaming, technology and digital content hub. This hub can bring Singapore significant economic opportunities, be an incubator for human capital development and, most importantly, a gateway to youth and community engagement. I am now moving on to my next point, the need to adapt to hybrid and digital events. As Singapore opens post-COVID-19, rather than making digital versions of traditional physical experiences, events need to leverage digital and hybrid extensions to engage audiences better. Singapore needs to encourage the arts and sports sectors to adapt. In the sports and arts industry, COVID-19 testing and safe management measures (SMMs) will remain for the foreseeable future. I want to encourage the Ministry to work together with event organisers and venues to ensure the safety of participants and spectators. We must also keep in mind the viability and sustainability of such events to create practical SMMs that make sense to everyone involved. Inclusivity and accessibility must be at the forefront of these experiences. Inclusion cannot be a fringe initiative. We must be proactive in designing and producing content that recognises and considers essential demographics. Gender, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, language, religion, physical and mental abilities and socioeconomic status are important parameters that we must not neglect. Singapore is our home. We want a future filled with opportunities and security for our families. Sports and the arts are arguably the two most universal and influential languages we have. I seek clarity on how the Ministry intends to encourage and promote diverse participation in sports and the arts. I would like to ask the Ministry how it can empower the underrepresented and marginalised populations to feel included via sports and the arts.\"], ['Ms Janet Ang', 'Mdm Chairman, our arts and culture scene in Singapore plays an essential role in bringing people together from diverse backgrounds and generations. Here, in Singapore, we are very fortunate to enjoy widespread access to arts and heritage facilities. Pre-COVID-19, we were able to enjoy creative offerings by both local and international artists. As we emerge from COVID-19, I believe we need to redouble our efforts in bringing back arts and culture into our community and not undermine the many aspects of what it can offer, of which I will discuss two. One: one challenge for society in recent years is that with online and social media, we risk taking out bigotry into the virtual space and echo chambers get formed very quickly. COVID-19 has probably made things worse. Society is becoming more polarised, more divisive. I believe that arts can offer a safe space for difficult issues to be discussed but also a space where differences can be better understood. One example is A Tapestry of Sacred Music, which is a month-long festival at the Esplanade taking place, in fact, this month. How precious it is that music from different faiths, traditions and communities can coexist? This is also very much a part of what it means to be Singaporean – our ability to appreciate and celebrate our diversity. Two: another challenge coming out of COVID-19 is that the most vulnerable in society as well as our young have had that quality of human interaction greatly diminished. The arts and cultural spaces are ways for us to safely rebuild that sense of community. Tough issues, for example, bullying, which is an increasing challenge our young people face today can be more comfortably discussed by kids, parents and teachers when presented in art form. In fact, the annual March On festival is back at the Esplanade with many activities for the young but also a theatre production and workshops about bullying. For the young, in particular, art can help kids open up, offer a way for them to learn about themselves and the world more holistically, to develop empathy, imagination but also an appreciation of Singapore in the world. I have two quick questions. May I ask how MCCY will continue to develop vibrant and inclusive arts and cultural spaces to provide opportunities for diverse communities, especially those who are underserved and vulnerable? My second question is that the Arts and Culture Resilience Package was much appreciated by our community. Going forward, to ensure a vibrant, resilient ecosystem for the arts and culture sector, how will MCCY plan to build back this community to co-create new innovative and sustainable models together with actors across the value chain in this sector? Arts and culture have and can play an important part to booster our fraternity, solidarity and mettle. Let me close with a quote by Howard Schultz of Starbucks, \"When you are surrounded by people who share a passionate commitment around a common purpose, anything is possible.\"'], ['Mr Sitoh Yih Pin', 'Mdm Chairman, in every country, arts and heritage play a pivotal role in connecting communities and instilling pride and optimism towards the future. It is an essential part of nation building. We are very proud of how far our artists and cultural institutions have come over the years. We must, therefore, ensure that we do our utmost in continuing to support them in the best way possible. The COVID-19 pandemic, as we know, put the hard brakes on the positive development in the arts. The cancellation of productions, the drastic drop in tourist numbers and reduced audience size severely affected the arts sector. MCCY has been cognisant of this and, in an effort to uplift the sector through the pandemic, introduced the Arts & Culture Resilience Package (ACRP) to protect livelihoods and build capabilities. The ACRP was enhanced with $20 million in March 2021, bringing it to a total of $75 million over two years. At the Committee of Supply (COS) last year, MCCY had shared that the first tranche of the ACRP created over 13,000 work and training opportunities, of which, 5,000 were for self-employed practitioners. It also supported over 1,400 digitalisation projects. I, therefore, invite the Minister to share with this House an update on the impact of the ACRP and the support provided to cultural organisations and self-employed persons. Given that we are in a much better position now to resume more and more arts and culture activities progressively in line with what the national health situation allows, I also invite the Minister to share MCCY’s strategies to revitalise the arts sector as we move forward into the new normal, so as to ensure that our arts groups and practitioners are well-positioned to thrive in the years ahead. Having adequate funding is a key component for any project or programme to achieve the goals set. The arts, culture and heritage sectors are no different. Beyond Government funding, the private and people sectors are key partners of the arts and culture community. Philanthropy has, traditionally, been an important source of funding for the arts groups and practitioners. The Cultural Matching Fund (CMF) supports the endeavour to attract private cash donations as it provides dollar-for-dollar matching grants to registered charities in the arts, culture and heritage sectors. Over the years, this has boosted private sector giving significantly and is also well-received by arts groups. I note that MCCY had shared at COS 2021 that a review of the CMF would be conducted, with a view towards an additional top-up of the fund. This top-up was announced by Finance Minister Lawrence Wong in his Budget 2022 Statement. I, therefore, invite the Minister to provide an update on the outcome of the review and to share with us MCCY’s strategies to ensure a sustainable arts, culture and heritage ecosystem where Singaporeans can contribute and play a part in. The National Arts Council (NAC) and the National Heritage Board (NHB) had previously launched the SG Arts & Heritage Plans which identified the priorities for Singapore’s arts and heritage development for 2018 to 2022. Both Plans set out bold visions to champion and cultivate the appreciation and development of the arts and our heritage. We are now at the tail end of both plans. I understand that NAC and NHB have started engagements for the next iterations of both plans. I, therefore, invite the Minister to share with this House an update on the progress of the plans, whether MCCY is of the view that both plans managed to succeed in what they had set out to achieve and an elaboration, if any, on the development of the next five-year plans for these sectors. Madam, I would also like to add that we must recognise that we have many talented artists and cultural practitioners in Singapore who can make important contributions to the future economy of Singapore. It is, therefore, important as we look ahead that the Government considers the development of the culture and creative economy. One way that we can do so is to enable our cultural organisations and practitioners to capture new opportunities, such as those in adjacent sectors within the creative economy and those brought about by digital technology. Seen in these perspectives, I invite the Minister to share MCCY’s strategies to bring our arts and culture to new and further heights in the future. Our heritage plays an important role in understanding who we are as a nation. It represents a part of our shared history. As a multiracial and multicultural society, it is pivotal that we preserve and promote our heritage as it is a core ingredient in building our national identity and sense of belonging as a people. We must, therefore, always remain committed to safeguarding our heritage for future generations of Singaporeans. One example is the successful inscription of our Hawker Culture on UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) of Humanity. Hawker culture is part and parcel of the everyday life of Singaporeans. It is a place where we come together to enjoy a meal together. From traditional favourites, such as chicken rice, nasi lemak or mee goreng to new fusion options, such as chicken chop laksa spaghetti or smoked salmon and lala congee, our hawker food culture has evolved and grown into something that is distinctly Singaporean. And we should all be very proud of it. I, therefore, invite the Minister to share MCCY’s plans to further safeguard and celebrate our shared heritage and how we can continue to engage the community to sustain interest in, and deepen our appreciation for our cultural heritage.'], ['Ms Tin Pei Ling', \"Arts and culture can help cultivate one's mind, preserve our history and values, and deepen Singapore's influence abroad. The cultures and arts of different races have their own position and development in Singapore, thereby giving rise to our unique arts and culture. Arts and culture require human interactions and space for expression. However, COVID-19 has impeded human interactions. Most Singaporeans in this industry are self-employed and have no organizational support, it is inevitable that they were hit harder during the pandemic. The Government launched the ACRP earlier. How is the progress so far and how is the Government helping arts and cultural workers to hone their craft while sustaining livelihood? With the rapid advancement of digital technology, how do we help these workers use digital platforms to create creative products and enter new markets? How will the Government revitalise the diverse cultural and arts scenes in Singapore, and ensure that Singapore continues to have our unique position in the world?\"], ['Mr Darryl David', 'Mdm Chairman, the cultural and creative sectors of our economy are crucial in their own right in terms of their economic footprint and the employment opportunities that they offer across the board. At the same time, we cannot underestimate the innovation that the arts and culture sectors spur across the economy. With wellness and inclusion as key focuses, the arts and culture also offer channels for positive social impact. They encourage education about Singapore’s identity and as well as revitalise our city life. Yet, the arts and culture sector has been hard-hit by the pandemic and has been severely disrupted by it. In addition to short-term support for artists and firms, which comes from both the public and private sector, policies can also leverage the economic and social impacts of culture in their broader recovery packages and efforts to transform our economy. With COVID-19, digital presentations have provided a lifeline, allowing audiences a new experience in the consumption of the arts. The digital space has provided both opportunities and challenges for local arts groups as they overcome the safe distancing measures and cross into a digital space that is not limited by physical boundaries. Yet, there is also a need to reimagine the business models used in the arts and culture sector so that they are sustainable. Offering free programmes worked for the short-run but the arts also need to be monetised. Effort needs to be placed on the protection of intellectual property in the digital space. Manpower planning and growth are also crucial as the arts groups rethink on how to increase capabilities to augment the production quality of digital works. Additionally, talent needs to be boosted through the exploration of new ways of blending digital formats with real-life arts and culture offerings. Training programmes for freelancers and collaborations with the private sector players are some of the ways to further talent growth to ensure sustained development of the arts and culture sectors. What are MCCY’s strategies to revitalise the arts and culture sectors and ensure that our organisations and freelancers are well-positioned to thrive in the new normal? Can MCCY provide an update on the impact of ACRP and the support provided to organisations and freelancers? Can MCCY elaborate on its plans to further strengthen the socio-economic nexus of our arts and culture sector, including manpower development and plans for digitalisation, to ensure that our artists are well-positioned to thrive in the new normal? The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on sports participation on many levels, including the cancelling or scaling down of mass participation events. Safe distancing measures as well as concerns about the danger of large clusters forming have had an impact on sports participation. At the same time, there are new developments in sports aimed at coping with the limitations of safe distancing measures. Capacity constraints in sporting venues and the limitations on the way team sport can be engaged has resulted in innovations. An example of innovative approaches to physical space are emerging, such as the use of small box gyms that offer physical fitness enthusiasts a new and different lease of life. Yet, sports and the communal nature of many sporting activities has a huge role to play in the psycho-social aspects of life. These benefits include cooperation, coping with confidence and shyness issues, dealing with stress and coping with aggression and violence. Sports can help curb social isolation and serve as a catharsis or outlet for those dealing with emotional issues. Sports also play a critical and important role in bringing Singaporeans together. Sports, whether it is through participation or spectatorship, foster a sense of pride and builds a confident nation, through interaction with athletes or sports fan bases. To paraphrase Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic Games, \"The important thing in life is not the triumph, but the fight; the essential thing is not to have won, but to have fought well.” So, in this regard, sports can be used to develop an individuals’ resilience as well. Can MCCY share its strategies to bring sports participation back into the new normal? Can MCCY share its strategies to restore and reinvigorate national sports participation, increase access to sports facilities, and reintroduce mass sport events in a safe manner? Sports has the ability to reinforce the idea of the importance of equality. For the fourth Paralympics in a row, Singapore’s para-athletes have come back with a haul of medals in spite of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Athletes, such as Yip Pin Xiu and Paraglider Jessica Goh, have gunned for gold, winning the hearts of Singaporeans. Other para-athletes, such as archer Nur Syahidah Alim, cyclists Steve Tee and competition partner Ang Kee Meng, have shown how sports can build an inclusive society through opportunities for talent to shine. In October last year, it was reported that Yip Pin Xiu will receive $800,000 for the two gold medals she won at the Tokyo Paralympic Games in August 2021. It is, indeed, commendable that sponsors, such as DBS and the Tote Board, have stepped in with the cash awards to help the athletes and reward them for their sacrifice. The work of the Singapore National Paralympic Council (SNPC), which focuses on enabling our elite para-athletes to participate in major games, such as the ASEAN Para Games, Asian Para Games, Asian Youth Para Games, Commonwealth Games and Paralympic Games, has also been crucial as the SNPC has undertaken collaborations to enable our para-athletes to soar. It is important to leverage on the international success of these para-athletes to encourage more sports participation at all levels. So, what is MCCY doing to provide more inclusive opportunities through sports? In line with MCCY’s commitment at the Parliament motion last year to honour our athletes, what is MCCY doing to support para-athletes and provide more opportunities for our aspiring para-athletes, especially for those who wish to pursue sports at a competitive level to represent Singapore in the international arena? Can MCCY also elaborate on its strategies to provide more inclusiveness through sports in the next phase of the Disability Sports Master Plan? In sports it is not the will to win that matters but the will to prepare to win according to Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, the late American football coach. At some of the major games such as the Southeast Asian Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Olympic Games, major games preparation is an important ingredient in the athletes’ preparation to enhance performance and recovery. Madam, these games and the results achieved can only be reinforced through advance planning and real-time involvement and investment in scientific methods. Effort also needs to be placed on minimising the distractions and stress faced by athletes during games time, enabling them to focus on their performance. There is also much behind-the scenes work by organisations such as Sports Singapore and the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) that have collaborated to prepare for major games to deliver preparation plans, games preparation workshops, performance analysis. Enhanced sports medicine as well as sports science are being employed to support athletes in their games preparations. There is also the need to invest time and funds in coaching and providing the best in terms of infrastructure, programmes and sports facilities so that our athletes can thrive, stress-free and focused on delivering an optimum performance. Mdm Chairan, given the pressures that they face, athletes’ mental health is just as crucial so that they can deal with the pressure that intense competition brings. All this preparation and investment is only meaningful and only possible if there is psychological support for the athletes and their efforts. Can MCCY provide an update on how Team Singapore athletes are progressing in their preparation for the major games in 2022 and beyond? What efforts are underway to rally Singaporeans to support Team Singapore. Sports has the potential to galvanise and inspire the nation? Can MCCY share its efforts to rally Singaporeans to show their support for Team Singapore, and also to provide platforms for Team Singapore athletes to connect with and inspire Singaporeans?'], ['Miss Cheng Li Hui', 'Mdm Chairman, in December 2021, it was reported that about 85,000 fans turned out at our National Stadium to watch the 16 Suzuki Cup football matches. That was the biggest mass sports event in Singapore since the pandemic. It brought together many Singaporeans from all walks of life to cheer on the Lions. For some of us, the matches certainly brought back the fond memories of the Kallang Roar at the old national stadium. Many of us who grew up watching Malaysia Cup will fondly remember Fandi, Sundramoorthy and super-sub Steven Tan. Actually, my family really scream every time Steven Tan comes on. But those were the days, but Mdm Chairman, the recent Suzuki cup is a good first step to revive our national sports scenes and to reignite interest in sports. Such sporting events unite Singaporeans and foster a strong sense of pride. I would like to ask the Ministry for an update on Unleash the Roar project and its vision to unite Singaporeans of all ages, races and gender through football. Madam, since the pandemic hit us in 2020, the various measures put in place meant that we had no choice but to reduce our participation in sporting events and matches. National sports participation has also been severely disrupted and the facilities bookings limited. What are the Ministry’s plans to restore national sport participation and reintroduce mass sports event in a safe manner? Madam, before the pandemic, we used to hold free bowling clinics in Tampines East, during school holidays for children from lower-income families. We would reserve two lanes for differently abled children and engage a coach from the Bowling Association for Disabled (Singapore) to guide them. Subsequently, Our Tampines Hub also held a once-off beginner cycling session for differently-abled children. These programmes were very welcomed by their parents. These children require special guidance and there is a lack of suitable programmes for them. It would be wonderful if they can join their families for cycling or bowling events after this training. On the national stage, many Singaporeans also cheered on Yip Pin Xiu and our Paralympic team in Tokyo Paralympics last year. Can the Ministry elaborate on its strategies to provide more inclusive opportunities through sports in our Disability Sports Master Plan? How can we provide more opportunities for our aspiring para-athletes to pursue sports at a competitive level?'], ['The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai)', 'Mdm Chairperson, this pandemic has affected our daily lives in almost every respect. As Mr Sitoh Yih Pin points out, this crisis of a generation has tested the very core of our resilience, as a society. MCCY and our stakeholders have felt this very keenly. We are a people-oriented, people-focused and community-building Ministry. Community and camaraderie are the bedrock of cohesion. This, however, requires the coming together of people, which is something that we have not been able to do quite so easily. Arts, culture, heritage, religion and sport, to name a few, are critical pieces in our country’s path towards development and progress. They give us our unique sense of identity, instill pride in us as a people of Singapore and foster a collectively stronger, more cohesive community. These are the foundational cornerstones of our society. The pandemic has underscored just how important those pieces are. Hence, when Singaporeans interact less, when our young people stop playing sport with one another, when Singaporeans do not come together to enjoy cultural and community events together, the bonds that bind us will gradually weaken. The long term effects, if not addressed, may erode our sense of \"us\" in years to come. And we will suffer a deficit in social trust. So, in these unprecedentedly difficult times, we will redouble our efforts to replenish and fortify the connections that bring us together. Our arts, heritage and sports sectors are that critical social \"glue\" that bind us together, instil pride and give us a warm sense of belonging to our Singapore. To strengthen the threads of our social fabric, we must deepen the partnership amongst Singaporeans and with the Government. This is the spirit of Singapore Together, where Singaporeans shared their post-COVID-19 aspirations for society during the Emerging Stronger Conversations (ESCs) conversations that were concluded last year. Mr Mark Chay asked about the progress of the ESCs. We have been working with Singaporeans to translate these aspirations into reality. Conversation must, therefore, become action. In this vein, 31 Singapore Together Alliances for Action (AfAs), involving over 34,000 individuals from the people, private and public sectors were formed to address key themes, for example, the AfA on Lower-Wage Workers, which spearheaded eight ground-up projects to uplift lower-wage workers. The ESCs and AfAs were convened in spite of COVID-19, because Singaporeans wanted to come together to rebuild our Singapore together. We will do more to harness this spirit, and to work collaboratively with the public. Our arts and culture practitioners were put through a difficult period. We navigated it, with financial support and targeted support. But we know that ultimately, audiences are the life blood of the arts. Therefore, the resumption of arts and culture activities in a safe manner has been a priority for us. Over the past year, we have allowed more activities to resume safely as we continued to simplify and streamline safe management measures (SMMs). We increased the number of audiences and participants who can enjoy these activities. We simplified SMMs for performers and crew, so larger productions can be staged, especially international productions, and we provided support to preserve core capabilities and ensure a smooth resumption of activities. Whilst the situation remains dynamic, MCCY and our agencies will continue to advocate on behalf of the arts and culture, and the sports sectors, for a safe reopening. We remain committed to supporting our sectors through this recovery. The Government will introduce the Small Business Recovery Grant (SBRG) and will also extend the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) to end-2022. This will help support small organisations as well as lower to middle-income workers and self-employed persons (SEPs) affected by the COVID restrictions, including those in the arts and culture sector, and the sports sector. Mr Darryl David, Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked about the impact of the $75 million Arts, Culture and Resilience Package (ACRP), which was introduced in April 2020. The ACRP demonstrated the Government’s clear commitment towards supporting the arts, culture and heritage sectors since the pandemic started. This support was critical, safeguarding jobs and livelihoods, and also protecting talent in the sector. The ACRP and broad-based support schemes supported over 900 arts and culture organisations. Of these, 241 organisations were supported under the ACRP Operating Grant, to sustain operations and make for more nimble adjustments in response to the pandemic. We understood how SMMs and venue capacity limits weighed painfully on the sector, with lower revenues arising from reduced audiences or visitor capacities. To support our arts groups, we introduced the Venue Hire Subsidy (VHS) to defray performance costs. This encouraged the resumption of activities and also brought back vibrancy to our arts and cultural scene, with more than 1,700 live performances and other cultural events supported in 2020 and 2021. For example, the re:SOUND collective made use of the VHS to hold a concert, Tapestry with Jeremy Monteiro. This was held at the Singapore Conference Hall. Likewise, groups like Pangdemonium and The Singapore Ballet also utilised the VHS. I was present at Tapestry some weeks ago. I was present at the Singapore Ballet a few nights ago and I will be present at Pangdemonium\\'s performance this Saturday at the Victoria Theatre. I hope that Members will also support the arts in the same way. We also used the ACRP to provide opportunities through digitalisation and transformation to meet future challenges. Over 1,500 digitalisation projects were supported under the ACRP through the Digitalisation Fund, including the Digital Presentation Grant (DPG). This allowed the sector to obtain invaluable experience innovating in these new frontiers. Together with the Capability Development Scheme for the Arts (CDSA), we created close to 15,000 work and training opportunities for the sector in 2020. On the back of these gains, we took a longer-term view in 2021 – when we understood the pandemic a little more and we understood the sectors a little better. We wanted to look beyond the pandemic, and position the sector for a strong recovery post-COVID and in the mid to longer term. With the second tranche of the ACRP, we supported transformation efforts that encouraged even greater collaboration within the sector to explore opportunities, share best practices and come together to tackle common issues. More than 100 transformation projects by over 190 organisations were supported by the Organisation Transformation Grant (OTG). Self-employed persons (SEPs) and organisations also came together to develop projects supported by the SEP Grant (SEPG), creating over 5,000 work and training opportunities for our SEPs. We will fully utilise the $75 million for the ACRP by the end of this Financial Year (FY). To build on the gains that we have made, we will provide an additional $12 million in FY2022 in continued support of our arts and culture practitioners. The VHS will also be extended. Last year, we incorporated the CDSA and DPG into NAC and NHB’s ongoing grants, and this year we will also incorporate the OTG and SEPG. Ms Janet Ang asked how we will continue to provide vibrant arts and culture spaces, and about our plans to co-create new models for the sector. Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Darryl David and Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked about our efforts to revitalise the sector. Madam, they are right. We must act proactively to protect and sustain a thriving and innovative arts and culture sector. If arts and culture become unintended casualties of the pandemic, we will lose a sense of who we are as a nation and what makes us special as a people. Therefore, we will work with the community to ensure that the sector remains vibrant, innovative, and more importantly, forward-looking, and continues to provide good and meaningful jobs; that the landscape continues to reflect our shared values, our ethos and our social mores, inspires and uplifts us and forges a strong sense of national identity. Our key focus areas are: First, digitalisation as a key enabler for the sector to engage new and existing audiences and complement existing revenue streams. To encourage more widespread digital adoption, we worked closely with stakeholders and tech partners to develop the Arts and Culture Digital Roadmap which was launched in February this year. Second, enhancing conditions for our Self-Employed Persons (SEPs). Our arts and culture landscape depends heavily on the rich talent of our freelancers. They are creative and talented, and are a source of spontaneity and innovation. We value them and want to help them to continue to thrive and contribute. Therefore, we will work with partners to help SEPs build up their skills, improve working conditions, explore new ways for them to create value in the arts sector and also in the wider creative economy. Third, developing vibrant and inclusive arts and culture spaces to keep up with the emerging trends and better meet practitioners’ needs. One example is 45 Armenian Street (45AS). We have asked leaders in the arts community to help envision the space and how it can best be operated and managed. I thank the Chair of Art Outreach Mae Anderson, the Vice Chair of Wild Rice Janice Koh, and co-artistic director of Independent Archive Shaiful Risan, as well as other members of the 45AS Resource Panel for so generously sharing your time, your expertise and your experience with us, and also engaging with the wider community, to collaborate with NAC. To ensure that 45AS remains a safe space for artistic experimentation, one that supports the work of a young, emerging practitioners and is always inclusive, multi-disciplinary as an arts space. My colleague, Minister of State Low Yen Ling will elaborate further on our focus areas to strengthen the sector. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked for an update on the Cultural Matching Fund (CMF). The CMF was set up in 2013 to encourage cultural philanthropy, to push arts and heritage charities to also diversify their income streams via fundraising, with dollar-for-dollar matching of private cash donations to arts and heritage charities. This enhances the resilience of our arts and heritage charities, and there has been an encouragingly strong response to this. Arts and heritage charities received over $300 million in CMF grants, reflecting donations catalysed by the CMF since its inception. To date, a total of 111 arts and heritage charities applied to CMF at least once. This 111 represents over two-thirds of the total number of arts and heritage charities in Singapore. Many charities have also embarked on their own fundraising for the first time to diversify their revenue streams. We want to sustain the momentum of giving and to encourage charities to keep up fundraising efforts and develop stronger relationships and forge relationships with their own ecosystem of donors. There will therefore be a top-up of $150 million into the CMF. The top-up will encourage cultural philanthropy and enhance the sustainability of the arts and heritage sectors. The CMF will complement existing initiatives to provide stronger support to smaller charities to develop their own governance and fundraising capabilities. Our cultural heritage plays an important role in growing a strong, confident society by anchoring our own unique Singaporean identity and telling stories that are our own, and that define and inspire us as a country. The Padang, for example, has borne witness to many significant national events. The site is an instantly recognisable enduring testament to our history as a people and as a country. NHB is working towards the gazetting of the Padang as a National Monument on National Day later this year. Madam, even as we safeguard our tangible heritage, we will continue to preserve and celebrate our intangible heritage. We were very proud some time ago, when our hawker culture was inscribed on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) list. We are now looking at a second UNESCO ICH nomination. There are some exciting possibilities, I will not share them here yet. We have sought views on them and we will think about them a bit more, think about how else and what are the possible nominations and will continue to engage with our relevant stakeholders, as well as the public, before reaching a decision. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked for an update on our long-term vision for the arts and culture sector. Madam, it is a good question. Even as we work on the here and now, and Members will see that we have many initiatives on the here and now, we have kept a clear eye on the future. Since mid-2021, we have been actively engaging stakeholders in the sector to develop a vision for the next Arts and Heritage Plans, and will further engage stakeholders this year. The Arts and Heritage Plans 2.0 will continue to build upon the vital role played by the arts and heritage in deepening our national identity. Again, Minister of State Low Yen Ling will give more details on the Arts and Heritage Plans 2.0. Madam, let me now turn to sports. Mr Darryl David and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked about strategies to bring sports participation back, and Mr Mark Chay asked a series of questions about sports entertainment, and in particular digital content, to promote Singapore’s culture and identity. Miss Cheng, in particular, spoke with such passion about the National Stadium. I think she showed her vintage naming those players, but I would suggest that we look forward as well. Irfan Fandi, Gabriel Quak, Jacob Mahler are some names of the future. We have been supporting the sport and fitness industry to enhance their value proposition through digitalisation, to transform the way they present, and in turn, the way we consume and experience, activities and sporting content. The ActiveSG Circle has partnered stakeholders to develop more than 3,000 hours of digital content since 2020, and to date, has accumulated a viewership of 67 million, with five million unique visitors. This is very encouraging and we will continue with this effort. SportSG also closely supports the sports and fitness industry in expanding their blended digital and physical offerings, including events and competitions, like the Arena Games Triathlon to be held in May this year, which will blend live and virtual reality experiences for a truly immersive experience. We have also been nudging digital production and innovation through the Sports Resilience Package (SRP), which was enhanced to a total of $75 million last year. To date, more than 600 businesses were supported by the SRP. The SRP will sustain the momentum of innovation, such as through the Enterprise Innovation and Capabilities Development Grant (InnoGrant), which supports businesses in applying technology and innovative solutions. Through these, some sport businesses are fundamentally transforming the way we experience sports. For example, SportSG\\'s \"Blended\" initiative supports businesses through areas such as data analytics and fan engagement, so that they can better develop hybrid experiences which better connect with the audience. With Blended\\'s support, 18 hybrid events reached over 90,000 participants. One such event is RIDEnjoySG, an innovative campaign that encourages participants to cycle safely on bike paths and park connectors whilst at the same time, enjoying real-world rewards via location-based challenges and augmented reality. Madam, 2021 was a thoroughly exciting year for sports, despite the many uncertainties and challenges. We progressively resumed sporting activities and also hosted several international events. In 2022, we want to step it up. Like arts, sports is a social \"glue\" that brings us together, as we cheer on our athletes fighting hard for Singapore, or as we develop friendships by simply engaging in a game or two on the field or on the court. We will commit $20 million to our Bring Sport Back programme in 2022. This is designed to reinvigorate Singapore sports, bring people back to play and enjoy sports together, and through sports, reconnect with one another. Bring Sport Back will focus on three key elements. First, we will safely reintroduce mass participation events for all, through more community events and sports festivals. To facilitate this, SportSG will be opening a grant call to fund mass participation events at up to $50,000 per award under the Blended Events Grant – Bring Sport Back edition. Second, we will ramp up community participation in sports through enhanced programming and more group activities. Currently, more than 170 facilities have already resumed \"5 against 5\" team sports. We are working on resuming larger team sports capacities across more facilities around Singapore, bringing it back to full capacity in several phases. We will roll out more leagues and competitions for people of all ages under the ActiveSG umbrella. These include the ActiveSG Cup launch and ActiveSG Leagues for Athletics, Badminton and Canoeing. ActiveSG Academies and Clubs will ramp up capacity of high-quality programmes, to strengthen sport development, social integration, health and wellness and inculcate strong values of resilience and determination, values that one can get through sport participation. They will also offer additional pathways for youth development at the elite level. We have also picked up growing interest in pickleball – I think some Members may be familiar with that sport - an increasingly popular sport particularly amongst our seniors. We will continue to keep our ears to the ground, and will in this case, for pickleball, increase the frequency of this and any other popular activities that will bring people back to sports. Third, we will optimise facilities and spaces to encourage people to return and to play together. These spaces will be community-driven, serving the unique needs of our different neighbourhoods. These include repurposing spaces for a range of sports and converting underused spaces into outdoor gyms. We hope that these measures will encourage Singaporeans to resume sporting and wellness activities safely. Madam, as we raise our ambitions in sports, we also want to emphasise the values that unite and promote an inclusive \"Sense of Us\" – who we are as fellow Singaporeans. One of the values that Singaporeans hold dear is inclusivity. We must build a society where everyone, regardless of their own circumstances in life, can take part and can flourish. I appreciate very much Miss Cheng Li Hui\\'s and Mr Darryl David\\'s questions on inclusive sports. There are several aspects to this, for which we have a few broad initiatives. First, SportSG will introduce the Para Sport Academy, under ActiveSG\\'s Academies and Clubs, to create more opportunities for persons with disabilities to pursue their sporting ambition at a competitive level. I spoke during my earlier Parliamentary Motion last year about the unique ability of sports to enhance an individual\\'s own self-confidence and to transform community attitudes towards a person with disabilities. Sports is one arena where we can and indeed we should, level everyone up. Through sports, we can empower persons with disabilities in deeply profound ways to help them realise their full potential, and raise their visibility and prominence in society. For many para-athletes, their stories attest to the value of sports in Singapore, playing a pivotal part in building an inclusive society. The Para Sport Academy will bring us one step closer, one step further along this journey, ensuring our para-athletes will have an equal platform and as much opportunity as any other to scale the pinnacle of sporting excellence. Second, sports can uplift and motivate. In that spirit, SportCares will be collaborating with ComLink to offer programmes to vulnerable youths, families and seniors. SportCares will also roll out a mentoring programme and will also offer bursaries, scholarships and internships for youths from disadvantaged backgrounds. Both of these initiatives will provide enhanced opportunities for those with disabilities or from less privileged backgrounds to achieve their hopes and dreams, and use sports to uplift themselves. My colleague, Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua will share more details on these two initiatives, as well as other sports developments which to look forward to. As Ms Joan Pereira said, this year marks the 20th anniversary of our Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs). Many Members, in fact, know that our IRCCs have been instrumental in shaping our interfaith harmony over the years. Their mission to strengthen our social cohesion remains as important today as it was 20 years ago when we first set it up. IRCC was first formed in 2002, at a time when the world was reeling in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and Singapore had also just uncovered the Jemaah Islamiyah plot to attack embassies on our own soil. We now have IRCCs in every constituency, with over 1,500 members comprising key leaders from various religious organisations, grassroots, community leaders and other stakeholders. The IRCCs have, over the years, been a critical bridge between the different community groups, building bridges, building trust and friendships and just doing day to day things, so that the lived experience enhances those bonds. On average, the IRCCs organise over 250 activities each year, including dialogues on different faiths, practices and festivals, and joint collaborations to support each other in times of need. We agree with Ms Pereira that we should do more to open the common spaces, to listen and learn about other faiths, other religions, other practices, without prejudice. The IRCCs also act as a conduit between the Government and community by highlighting issues emerging on the ground, providing insights and ideas. Mr Fahmi Bin Aliman asked how we plan to step up social cohesion efforts. Ms Joan Pereira and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked how we plan to keep IRCCs effective and relevant and promote a more inclusive nation. Madam, as a basic requirement, we must ensure that our IRCCs will continue to foster mutual trust on the ground. They are bridges and connectors on the ground across communities. At the same time, we are also operating and very quickly moving into a rapidly changing landscape. We will therefore have to refresh our IRCCs so that they stand ready to respond to future challenges, such as evolving societal attitudes, increasing fault lines and the pervasive impact of social media on race and religious relations, like some Members have highlighted earlier. We must also anticipate the challenges in the next bound. To this end, we have formed a Workgroup to review how we can refresh our IRCCs to continue strengthening our racial and religious harmony. The Workgroup comprises members who are experienced IRCC leaders, representatives from religious organisations, civil society leaders and groups and community partners as well as youth leaders who play an integral and instrumental part in shaping what we want to be doing in the future to promote racial and religious harmony. Over the next few months, the Workgroup will consult widely with a range of community stakeholders, identify the strengths and challenges faced by the IRCCs, look at some of the issues, look at how we can tackle them and put forward their recommendations. I look forward to the Workgroup presenting its recommendations later on this year and I will share them with Members of this House. Next, Madam, Ms Joan Pereira asked how we can continue to strengthen community life at the neighbourhood level and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked how we can increase care and cohesiveness in Singapore. At the heart of our communities and neighbourhoods are the Residents Committees (RC) and Residents\\' Networks (RNs) centres. The way to increase care, cohesiveness, bonds on the ground, is not necessarily to come up with special projects or special events to bring people together but to share as part of our daily lived experiences. When you step out of your home, when you go down to the common areas in the community – how can we foster that bond? Last October, I had announced that five centres would pilot the smart RC/RN concept, where these centres would be more accessible and better equipped, for example, with smart access control systems, so residents can access them at a time of their choice. The pilot centres allowed for enhanced use, fostered a greater sense of coming together and community and belonging for the neighbourhoods involved. We will progressively roll the pilot out across more RC centres in the second half of 2022 to take advantage of some of the gains we have seen from the pilot. Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman and Miss Cheng Li Hui also asked how MCCY plans to make volunteerism and care a greater part of our lives. To do so, the SG Cares movement and PA will generate multiple pathways for volunteerism so that everyone can play a part for the common good. There are several initiatives and I will just highlight one that the People\\'s Association is studying and will implement shortly. That is to broaden opportunities for volunteerism on the ground where as far as possible, we can do it on a fluid, informal and flexible basis. Let me explain that. First, working with the community to support volunteers, formal and informal who wish to work on specific causes. We will support volunteers in causes that they care about. Second, we want to partner with already existing networks on the ground to encourage community involvement and to reach out to potential networks of volunteers. Third, we will support these community volunteers in their projects through grants, cross-sharing of volunteering opportunities and also providing resources together with other agencies. The PA\\'s efforts also complement ongoing SG Cares\\' efforts to expand the base of volunteers through working with community partners. Madam, let me now touch on the prevalence of neighbourly disputes. Ms Tin Pei Ling, Mr Derrick Goh, Mr Gerald Giam, Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Gan Thiam Poh all asked about our processes to deal with such disputes and how we can enhance the use of mediation. Members will be aware that in 2014, the Community Dispute Management Framework (CDMF) was introduced. The framework was aimed at facilitating effective resolution of common neighbourly disputes to seek to foster a more harmonious living environment. An inter-agency workgroup has been reviewing this framework. Mr Gerald Giam asked who was involved. MinLaw and MCCY, MND and MHA are involved in this review. As I also mentioned in my MinLaw COS speech, our agencies are exploring a range of enhancements to the framework. These cover both upstream measures to promote pro-social norms and downstream measures to enhance our response to disputes, addressing situations where disputes would benefit from mediation and possibly dispute resolution at the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT). Madam, we recognise that some disagreements such as neighbour-generated nuisances, noise nuisances, and local and neighbourly disamenities may not always meet the threshold for intervention by Government agencies. Oftentimes, they are also best suited for mediation, which provides not just a quick, friendly, informal process to deal with, but also one, which as far as possible preserves the existing relationship between the two neighbours. One that is amicable and conciliatory in nature. However, at present, as some Members have pointed out, the mediation take-up rate remains low despite this being a proven effective means to resolve disputes. We are therefore considering three broad areas of enhancements to better manage such disagreements. First, we will collaborate with residents to strengthen the spirit of neighbourliness and graciousness through shared norms. In her MND COS speech, my colleague, Senior Minister of State Sim Ann spoke about forming a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) on Neighbourhood Noise. This panel will seek to build consensus through community norms that can be a useful guide for determining acceptable behaviours amongst neighbours and also serve as a useful reference point for agencies in advising residents to be considerate neighbours. Second, we are considering ways to improve our dispute resolution mechanisms, both in mediation and in the CDRT. For mediation, we intend to increase the take-up rate for mediation, both formal and informal. The Community Mediation Centre (CMC) has a high settlement rate – I mentioned this previously and I will mention it again. For every 10 cases that go before the CMC, 8.8 of them are resolved. That is a very high number. This shows that when parties avail themselves of this process, formal mediation is very effective and should be the preferred mechanism for resolving neighbourly tensions. We are looking into increasing awareness on the benefits of mediation. The CMC has been using social media to promote its services and has also been reaching out to frontline officers to promote the benefits of mediation and the referral process. We are exploring more varied modes of mediation to increase accessibility, for example, doing online virtual mediation. Additionally, we are also studying the feasibility of mandating mediation in appropriate circumstances and in those cases, requiring disputing neighbours to undergo mediation before filing a claim with the CDRT. This is so neighbours may resolve differences amicably as far as possible, without first going through the CDRT process, which is adjudicatory and often zero-sum in nature. We are also considering possible consequences for parties who fail to attend mediation and yet, want to pursue a claim at the CDRT. Mr Gerald Giam suggested that we allow adverse inferences to be drawn and we will consider that. We will also consider the other suggestions by Mr Gerald Giam, which were good suggestions on how to effectively promote mediation in such situations. We are also studying possible mechanisms for a CMC settlement agreement to be registered as an order of Court. This will then make it easier for the CMC to have its settlement agreements enforced as an order of Court. Madam, beyond these, grassroots and other community leaders also play an important role in preserving positive neighbourly relations and often partner frontline agencies in resolving such disputes. We will work on programmes to better equip our community leaders with the skills to informally mediate between residents. Very often, they are also a neighbour themselves and can be the best first responder to the situation to understand the context, the lay of the land and quite possibly be the respected person that both neighbours can look up to. These are the ingredients for a successful mediation. Mr Patrick Tay asked about the CDRT\\'s caseload. In the past five years, 721 claims have been filed with CDRT, with 138 cases ordered to undergo mediation at CMC or CDRC and 656 cases being disposed of by the CDRT. We are studying process changes to alleviate the difficulties which some parties face in navigating the CDRT process and to ensure greater effectiveness of the CDRT amongst the parties involved. These changes could include empowering the CDRT to obtain expedited relief, akin to an interim injunction, in egregious cases and introducing measures to deter non-compliance with CDRT orders more effectively. In cases where respondents breach the orders granted by CDRT, claimants have gone on to apply for Special Directions, Compliance Bonds and Exclusion Orders from CDRT. Mr Gerald Giam raised a point about uploading of evidence. The current requirement for audio and video recordings, which often are the most direct way in which you can show and substantiate your position to the CDRT, these are usually submitted using CD or DVD due to the need to preserve data integrity and security. Nonetheless, the Courts are continually reviewing their processes and will take into account Mr Giam\\'s point and assess the viability of alternatives to submit evidence in Court. In the meantime, Court users who require assistance to submit audio or video recordings to the CDRT can approach the CDRT Registry for assistance. Third and finally, we are looking to enhance processes and resources for a targeted response that can better assess the nature and scope of a complaint and attend to them quickly. One possibility could be a team of ground responders empowered to collect and share evidence or reports with the CDRT to alleviate the evidential burden for parties involved. More details will be announced as we continue with this review and the findings firmed up. Madam, the various initiatives I have spoken about today signals our commitment to ensure that we emerge from this pandemic not just stronger, but a more cohesive and more innovative as a society. Let me round up my response this afternoon by returning to sports and our sportsmen and sportswomen, all of whom exemplify the values and qualities we all aspire to, as a people. Mr Darryl David asked for an update on Team SG\\'s preparations for the major games in 2022. Let me just recap 2021. We had a successful 2021. Last year, all of us cheered our Olympians and Paralympians as they flew the Singapore flag high and proud in Tokyo. We celebrated the achievements of Loh Kean Yew and Aloysius Yapp who reached the pinnacles of their respective sports last year in badminton and in cue sports. Shayna Ng and Yip Pin Xiu, names which I am sure all of you recognise, continued to inspire us through world class performances in bowling and swimming. Our youth athletes did extremely well too. Colin Soon won four Gold medals at the Asian Youth Para Games for swimming, Maximilian Maeder won the Under-19 World Championships for kitefoiling and Izaac Quek, who is competing at the World Table Tennis (WTT) Singapore Smash won the Under-15 Singles title for table tennis. We will have a busy sporting calendar in 2022. We will have the Hanoi SEA Games in May, the Birmingham Commonwealth Games in July and August, the Hangzhou Asian Games and the Hangzhou Para Games in September and October respectively. I am confident that our Team SG athletes will continue to fly our flag high and inspire us with their resilience, fortitude and solidarity, the very same qualities that will enable Singapore to progress and develop on multiple fronts. I have spoken at length in Parliament earlier this year and last year, on the Government\\'s support for high performance sport and our Team SG athletes. We will continue to do so and enable each of our athletes to put their best foot forward in these competitions. We encourage all to support our Team SG athletes. Mdm Chairman, our transition out of the pandemic will not be without bumps and hurdles. Much of the impact that COVID-19 has on the sectors we care for is intangible and often latent. They are hidden. We have to ensure that we do not suffer a deficit in social resilience in our society even as we strive to protect lives and livelihoods in this pandemic. Madam, sports, culture, heritage – they hold a mirror to our society. They show us who we are, how far we have come and what we cherish, value and aspire to. Resilience in defeat and grace in victory. These are qualities that are like a microcosm of our society. As our athletes and artists succeed, so does our nation. More importantly, in sports, art, culture and heritage, we see that our diversity in race, colour and creed is in fact, our strength. These distinctions do not divide us; they enable us; they make us stronger. Whether it is on the playing field or under the stage lights, our athletes and artists show us that what matters is what we bring to the table – our unique gifts, talents and experiences – and our shared dreams. The qualities we see on the stage or on the pitch – grace under pressure, commitment to excellence, dedication to one another, to our team mates – are the very same ones we hold dear in society, that inspire in us pride, unity and courage, and the ability to dream even bigger together. They speak to the heart of Singapore. On that note, Madam, MCCY will ensure our arts, heritage amd sports sectors will emerge from this pandemic stronger, better, faster, and more vibrant, innovative and resilient. They will continue to inspire, unite and move us, as we continue to strengthen the heart of Singapore towards an even more caring, gracious and truly inclusive society.'], ['The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Low Yen Ling)', 'Mdm Chairman, in the last two years, MCCY, the National Arts Council (NAC) and the National Heritage Board (NHB) have rolled out wide-ranging measures to safeguard livelihoods, build capabilities and position our arts and culture sector for a strong recovery in the new normal. Kudos to our arts and culture organisations and practitioners – they have responded boldly and creatively to the challenges brought on by the pandemic. Through their craft and artistic contributions, they have provided soothing balm and comfort to us all in a difficult time like this. We are grateful for their resilience and perseverance. Looking ahead for the year 2022, we will continue to work closely with our arts and culture community to chart our path towards recovery. We will enlarge our longer-term plans with the aims to foster in Singapore a resilient, sustainable and future-ready arts and culture ecosystem that: one, enriches and inspires lives; two, unites us as a nation with pride in our shared heritage; and three, enhances Singapore’s shine as a global city. Today, we look forward to our arts and culture sector recovering even stronger than before from the pandemic. Our practitioners have reached new audiences, created new experiences and enhanced existing capabilities while developing new ones in areas like digital showcases. This is the result of our collective resolve over the last two years as the arts and culture community collaborate and support one another. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Darryl David will be pleased to know that we will do even more to sustain the momentum and enable the sector to build on these gains. As shared earlier by Minister Edwin Tong, we will be injecting an additional $12 million to sustain good practices and learning points from COVID-19 after the end of the Arts and Culture Resilience Package (ACRP). Let me elaborate. As we continue to adapt and move towards a new normal, we will extend the Venue Hire Subsidy for another three months from 1 April 2022 to 30 June 2022, at a stepped-down rate of 30%. This will continue to defray venue hire costs for our practitioners, as we progressively resume activities and welcome back larger audiences. Introduced last year as part of the ACRP, which is the Organisation Transformation Grant (OTG), has attracted keen interest from arts and culture organisations and practitioners. To sustain support for transformation, NHB will incorporate the OTG into its existing grants, such as the Heritage Research Grant, as well as the Minor and Major Project Grant. Heritage businesses and organisations will be able to benefit from an increased grant amount of up to $40,000, from $30,000 previously, to cater to larger-scale and longer-term projects. The grants will also be open to Business Associations to encourage transformation efforts in our historic districts. Similarly, NAC will launch a new Sector Transformation Fund (STF) to promote and sustain the transformation efforts of our arts and culture community. Projects previously supported under the ACRP Organisation Transformation Grant (OTG) that have longer-term potential for further development, can tap on the STF to push ahead and transform. Let me now share how we will boost the sustainability of the arts and culture sector for diverse communities to enjoy, a point passionately highlighted by Ms Janet Ang. We will empower the sector to leverage digital technologies to pursue new artistic, cultural and business opportunities. Through digitalisation, the sector can enhance their existing revenue streams, as well as improve productivity and organisational effectiveness. We recently launched the Arts and Culture Digital Roadmap on 28 February to equip and enhance the digital journey of our arts and culture organisations and practitioners. They can use the Digital Roadmap, which has a self-assessment checklist, to gauge their level of digital readiness and learn about the range of digital solutions and funding schemes available to businesses, charities and individuals that can support such efforts. As Mr Mark Chay pointed out, we can showcase our unique culture to local as well as overseas audiences by using more digital content. For instance, Ding Yi Music Company brought their triennial international composition festival called \"Composium\" online last year, which led to its musicians and compositions of local composers, such as Cultural Medallion recipients Eric Watson and Law Wai Lun, reaching international audiences. In the coming months, MCCY, NAC and NHB will be engaging our arts and culture organisations and practitioners through roadshows and workshops to promote awareness of the Digital Roadmap. We will also provide tailored support to those who require assistance to digitalise. Details of these efforts will be made available on the websites of all three organisations, once ready. Madam, through the Self-Employed Person Grant (SEPG) introduced under the ACRP, SEPs have engaged in new collaborations. For instance, an independent producer, Ms Nurhafezhah Maznan, created a structured programme for eight young theatre directors to learn from 17 artists and other creatives, how to direct works in Malay and Tamil. We will continue to deepen our support for Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) by incorporating the SEPG into NAC’s existing Presentation and Participation (P&P) and Capability Development (CD) grants. Ms Tin Pei Ling will be glad to know that through this move, priority will be given to grant applications initiated by or targeted at SEPs. In addition, we are committed to creating conditions in the arts and culture sector for livelihoods to thrive, with targeted support for SEPs. First, we will increase opportunities for capacity development for SEPs. To this end, NAC will raise greater awareness of the skills and competencies that our SEPs need to help them make informed choices for their career progression. NAC will also work with partners to mount training courses in new and emerging areas such as e-pedagogy and digital arts education programme development for arts instructors. Second, NAC will work with industry partners to ensure better protection and working conditions for our SEPs. NAC will promote the adoption of best practices amongst organisations which engage SEPs – from the signing of formal contracts to improving contractual obligations between the parties and recognising our SEPs for their skills and contributions. For example, our national cultural institutions have adopted the Tripartite Standards on Contracting with Self-Employed Persons since 2018. Third, NAC will pilot new ways for SEPs to create value in the arts sector and beyond. NAC has observed some enterprising SEPs, especially in the last two years, developing artist-business partnership and testing new ways to work with enterprises working on sustainability solutions. NAC will support SEPs to push boundaries and contribute to the broader creative economy, as well as to collaborate with each other and new partners – such as local businesses – from other sectors in new and innovative ways. We encourage our SEPs to make full use of the available grants to sustain their practices, collaborate on new initiatives and develop new capabilities. We look forward to our SEPs\\' continued contribution to Singapore’s arts and culture. Madam, besides developing our people, MCCY is also working closely with the sector to strengthen our cultural infrastructure for artists and creatives to incubate, to experiment and to collaborate. One of the newest additions to this growing pool is the Singapore Art Museum (SAM) at Tanjong Pagar Distripark (TPD). I visited SAM at TPD just two months ago with Minister Edwin Tong in January for the 10th edition of the Singapore Art Week (SAW) 2022 and we saw for ourselves how a former industrial warehouse was turned into a fascinating location for experimental exhibitions and programmes. The TPD welcomed more than 17,000 visitors during SAW 2022 and its unique large space allowed the public to be immersed in various arts and culture experiences in a very engaging manner. Another exciting development is also taking place at Kampong Java. NAC is partnering the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) to refurbish and pilot arts and culture sandbox spaces at 52 to 56 Kampong Java. These venues that I have mentioned will offer our artists of various disciplines an affordable space to focus on their experimental and creative process. NAC will seek views from the arts community on the use of these spaces in the first half of this year. Madam, many of these cultural spaces are located at sites with a long history. Our built heritage connects us to the nation’s past, like what Mr Sitoh Yih Pin mentioned, and forms a part of our cultural identity. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin will be glad to know that MCCY is continuing to safeguard and celebrate Singapore’s shared heritage. One important aspect of this work involves the heritage impact assessment (HIA) framework, which Minister for National Development Mr Desmond Lee had shared earlier at MND\\'s Committee of Supply (COS). MCCY and NHB will continue to support MND and URA in implementing the HIA framework. The framework further strengthens how public agencies must thoroughly evaluate the heritage significance of a site as an important consideration in the early stage of planning for development projects. Our rich heritage is also a source of national pride. All Singaporeans celebrated when our hawker culture was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in December 2020. Last year, at COS, I shared that we would embark on consultations to identify possible elements for Singapore’s second UNESCO intangible cultural heritage nomination. Between June 2021 and January 2022, NHB held Focus Group Discussions with approximately 170 participants, comprising intangible cultural heritage practitioners, heritage business owners, academics and youths, to hear their views and their thoughts and suggestions. Through these conversations, we heard a clear preference for our second nomination to be multicultural in nature and relatable to Singaporeans. A total of 10 possible elements have been suggested through these consultations. For example, our Chingay Parade, the Making and Sharing of Kueh, Peranakan Beadwork and Embroidery, Orchid Cultivation and Yusheng, just to name a few. NHB will broaden its consultations over the course of the coming months to engage more stakeholders, as well as the general public, before a final decision is made on the element to be nominated. Mdm Chairman, our museums showcase our valuable heritage and I am glad to update that, come this December, families and young children can look forward to a dynamic and engaging experience at the new Children’s Museum Singapore (CMSG), in what used to be the Singapore Philatelic Museum. Ms Janet Ang spoke passionately about the importance of arts and culture for the young, and we agree with her. The CMSG will feature a range of topics, including Singapore’s history and biodiversity, and help foster a stronger awareness of our shared values and national identity in our young children. In another development, following extensive consultations with the community, the Peranakan Museum will reopen in 2023, with an expanded curatorial focus on the rich cross-cultural traditions and distinctive arts of the Peranakan communities in Southeast Asia. Besides looking forward to the CMSG and Peranakan Museum, Singaporeans can all play a part in shaping an important reflection of our heritage, the Founders’ Memorial. Next month, NHB will launch the Founders’ Memorial “Share Your Story, Shape Our Memorial” Travelling Exhibition. Besides an update on the Memorial’s architectural design, the travelling exhibition will provide the public a chance to share artefacts and stories related to key national policies or milestones, or their encounters with our founding leaders. For example, Mr Timothy de Souza is keen to share his personal mementoes as one of Singapore’s first fighter pilots. We look forward to rich and interesting contributions from all Singaporeans. Madam, looking ahead, MCCY will build upon the foundation and progress made by Our SG Arts Plan in 2018. Mr Sitoh Yih Pin would be glad to know that, today, our arts sector includes diverse talents who collaborate and create new arts experiences for audiences in Singapore and beyond, including the under-reached groups mentioned by Ms Janet Ang and Mr Mark Chay. Through signature arts festival platforms, such as SAW, which I mentioned earlier, Singapore International Festival of Arts and the Singapore Writers Festival, we have brought together diverse players in the local arts ecosystem, grown a strong audience base and profiled Singapore arts globally. Community partnerships have been forged across 20 Arts and Culture nodes, bringing people of different backgrounds together through the arts. Arts education has also been enhanced with experiential, cohort-based learning programmes to museums and concert halls, as well as digital content. Arts offerings are more inclusive than before, with support for quality arts experiences for our preschoolers as well as students with special needs. Since July 2021, NAC has held conversations with around 400 stakeholders in one-on-one interviews and also focus group discussions on the future of the arts for Singapore. Building on these insights, we are developing Our SG Arts Plan 2.0 to set the stage for the next phase of our arts development. First, we will strengthen the role of the arts in the wider local and global creative economy; second, we will develop further ways for the arts to contribute to deepening our national identity, social cohesion and inclusivity; third, make the arts a distinctive factor that adds to Singapore’s attractiveness as a global city. NAC welcomes feedback and ideas from the sector to refine Our SG Arts Plan 2.0. A public consultation will be conducted in the second part of this year. Let me now turn to Our SG Heritage Plan which has, since 2018, enabled Singaporeans to rediscover and affirm our shared values and identity through diverse offerings and multiple touchpoints. Our museums are now more accessible through digital initiatives and offerings that reach out to a larger audience. Seniors can now enjoy age-friendly programmes under the Silver Hubs initiative, while programmes under HeritageCares also reach out to lower-income families, persons with disabilities, children with special needs as well as youths-at-risk. Heritage is being infused into everyday spaces around us through the Street Corner Heritage Galleries scheme. Our Tampines Gallery, Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery and Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery have all enlivened local communities. Following NHB’s consultations with a diverse range of stakeholders that include insights from our museum community, youth, creatives, heritage societies and heritage business owners, NHB is drawing up plans for Our SG Heritage Plan 2.0. Firstly, we will support the heritage sector’s digital adoption and develop capabilities to transform their operations and efforts in connecting Singaporeans to our heritage; second, we will also showcase Singapore’s rich multicultural heritage beyond our shores to grow new audiences and markets for our heritage sector, while, at the same time, learning from the best in the world to develop our home talents; thirdly, we will work closely with our local communities as well as heritage enthusiasts and partners in the tech and creative industries to celebrate our unique local histories. We invite all Singaporeans to share your views and feedback for Our SG Heritage Plan 2.0 when NHB launches the public call in the middle of this year. Mdm Chairman, in Mandarin, please.'], ['The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Low Yen Ling)', \"Developing our local arts and heritage sectors enhances Singapore's vibrancy and attractiveness as a global city. Further, art pieces and heritage assets that resonate with Singaporeans will also strengthen our sense of belonging and help build a more cohesive and inclusive society. MCCY will strive to achieve these goals by continuing with our SG Arts and Heritage Plans. Since the launch of Our SG Arts Plan in 2018, we have profiled Singapore arts through signature arts platforms, forged community partnerships and brought arts across 20 arts and cultural nodes. This strengthens community involvement, including preschoolers, students with special needs and the elderly, ensuring that our arts scene becomes more inclusive and benefits more people. On the other hand, Our SG Heritage Plan, which was launched in 2018, has also allowed Singaporeans to rediscover and affirm their shared heritage. Preservation of more national monuments and the successful inscription of our hawker culture on the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage have also engendered greater public recognition of the value of heritage in our everyday lives. As the next step, NAC and NHB will broaden their consultations this year and continue their conversations with Singaporeans and partners from various fields as we co-create the next editions of Our SG Arts and Heritage Plans, so as to contribute to the creative economy and safeguard and promote Singapore's multicultural heritage.\"], ['The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Ms Low Yen Ling)', 'Mdm Chairman, MCCY and our agencies remain committed to working with the arts and culture community to revitalise our arts and culture sector and chart its future directions. As we build on the gains that we have made together over the past two years, we will carve an exciting journey ahead towards a thriving and sustainable arts and culture ecosystem – one that enriches livelihoods, one that unites our people and one that enlivens our city.'], ['Mr Darryl David', 'Chairman, many of us remember fondly the Kallang roar, although I agree with Minister Edwin Tong when he said earlier that while it is great to revel in nostalgia, we should also look forward to the future of the bright talents that we have coming up to the Singapore football pipeline. Last year, MCCY announced its strategic plan to revitalise our football ecosystem and improve the standards of football at all levels through its Unleash the Roar project, which of course, was mooted to bring back that Kallang Roar. The project relates to the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) goal for the national team to qualify for the 2034 FIFA World Cup – a noble and aspirational goal indeed. The project is a worthy one as it helps our youths undertake intensive and structured high-quality football training to play football professionally. Can MCCY provide an update on the progress of the Unleash the Roar project and its vision to unite Singaporeans of all ages, races and gender through football?'], ['Mr Abdul Samad', 'Chairman, soccer has always been a sport that unites our community since our national team participated in Malaysia Cup. Aside from Malaysia Cup matches back then, we used to host competitive international friendly tournament such as Merlion Cup which attracts participation from renowned international teams like South Korea and Saudi Arabia. At the last AFF Suzuki Cup between Singapore and Indonesia, where I was extremely fortunate to be physically inside the stadium with my family members and friends, we witnessed not just a match but strong Singapore fighting spirit from our players, coupled with crowd of multiracial and all ages cheering the team on. The crowd support for the team on that night was one of passion and certainly brings back memories of the past glory days. In fact, the closure for that was when the crowd stood up and sang our national anthem to show appreciation for the players. They may have lost the match, but they have certainly reignited the spirit of Kallang Roar. Chairman, the last time our local soccer created large interest in soccer was when we won the Malaysia Cup in 2015, even if the mood was less happening compared to 1994 when we won the Malaysian Cup League and Cup double. Sadly, after every success in Malaysia Cup for the last two occasions, we exited – either we exit by choice or Malaysia asked us to exit. I would like to appeal to MCCY and FAS to analyse and review on how we can bring back such moods in our local soccer to where it was at one time. How we can have more support for our local S league team just like Lion City Sailors. I would also call on big organisations to play a pivotal role by being main sponsor for all the S league clubs. Only with good sponsorships can clubs bring quality foreign players that complement our local players for more entertaining games that can also improve our local soccer standards. Singapore must develop more players with caliber of not just Quah Kim Song, but also like Harriss Harun, Faris Ramli, Jacob Mahler and Shahdan Sulaiman, for the future of our local soccer team that is not just of talent but inclusive of all races that reflect Singapore as a multiracial society. We hope by doing this, we do not just bring back the Kallang Roar, but we can even uplift the roar beyond Kallang and the Sports Hub!'], ['Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap', 'Sir, in December last year, our Singapore Lions men\\'s football team put up a brave fight, in the semi-final of the AFF Suzuki Cup. Although they were down to eight men, they put up a proud fight until the final whistle and could hold their heads up high despite the defeat. The team\\'s run in the tournament sparked a reinvigoration in local sentiments about our footballing scene. Twelve years ago, another team bearing Singapore colours sparked the imagination of local football fans – the Singapore Youth Olympic Games (YOG) football team. The players from that tournament were dubbed a \"Golden Generation\" not only for achieving a milestone bronze medal at the inaugural event, but also for their exciting style of play. And yet, a review of their fortunes a decade later told a story of a lost generation of footballers. While it is true that youth footballing success is no guarantee of future achievement, we must also be mindful of other factors such as failures in the training and development systems and the lack of quality in mentoring, coaching and grooming of young talents. Sir, it is my hope that those involved in the \"Unleash the Roar\" (UTR) project announced in March 2021 bear in mind the lessons learnt from the past and continually engage stakeholders such as coaches, club management, fans but most of all – the players. Just over the weekend, a feature on CNA asked the question, \"What does Singapore football need to raise its game?\" The feature struck a cautious yet optimistic note for the future of Singapore football. I welcome the small steps that have been taken under the UTR project such as the setting up of School Football Academies and partnerships with global leaders in football, such as clubs from the Spanish premier La Liga. However, it is disappointing that following the resignation of Mr Tatsuma Yoshida after the Suzuki Cup tournament, a replacement has yet to be announced. Sir, we must move fast or be left behind.'], ['Mr Mark Chay', 'Chairman, I would like to raise three points for MCCY to consider. One, additional funds for national teams. As Team Singapore takes the stage multiple times this year, I would like to ask for additional funds be allocated to enable our Team Singapore athletes a fair shot at preparing, qualifying and competing at these major international competitions. Two, additional resources to build our capabilities for sport science and administration. I would like if there are sufficient sports science resources and personnel to support our athletes. If not, what is the plan to ramp up in time for the games, and three, greater support for Team Singapore athletes serving their National Service. Many of our Team Singapore athletes are National Servicemen. I would therefore like to ask is provisions have been made to enable and support our National Servicemen who have qualified for the games, for instance, allowing them time out to train and compete. At the outset, I would like to declare the I am a coach with the Singapore Disability Sports Council. I would like to raise three points in this regard. I first speak on empowering coaches with the requisite knowledge and skills. As Singapore moves to be more inclusive in the sporting arena, it becomes all the more timely to ensure that coaches are equipped with the necessary skills to handle differently abled athletes. I would like to suggest CoachSG work together with the Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC) to develop and run courses. On coaching education in the broader sense, I am happy to note that CoachSG is working with experts at Leeds Beckett University to develop a coaching competency framework that would impact and shape our coaching development and education pathway in Singapore. I would like to ask how this study will manifest in the CoachSG courses, and just as importantly, how the study and the competency framework would result in greater recognition of coaches and their true value proposition in terms of remuneration. Chairman, I will move to my second point – recognising coaches and their accomplishments. In my Budget 2022 Debate speech, I listed five Singaporean athletes that emerged on top of the world in their respective disciplines. Can we name all their coaches who helped them achieve this feat? Do we know that these coaches were all local Singaporeans? And when was the last time we recognised a coach for a National Day Award? The achievements of coaches have not enjoyed the same level of recognition as our national athletes do, and this should not be the case. They are with our athletes every step of the way, and these coaches not only ensure the physical performance of our athletes, they also play important roles in developing the athletes in imparting values and ethics. I would therefore reason their jobs are as important and deserving of recognition as those teachers at our MOE schools. I would like to propose that coaches be recognised for their contributions to inspire more Singaporeans to take on the mantle of coach and groom generations of world champions to come. I now move to my final point – improving coaching standards and regulations. If we were to celebrate our coaches, we should also consider strengthening the regulatory framework which governs coaches and sports for that matter. The SafeSport Unified Code was launched last year and this was a huge step forward in ensuring the safety our participants in sports. However, there is a lacuna in its ambit. It only affects NROC-registered coaches. What happens if the alleged offender is, for instance, an unregistered coach, a team manager, or a volunteer? To plug this gap, I have two suggestions for the Ministry. One, develop a framework for licensing and compulsory registration for all sports coaches and instructors; and two, extend the registration to administrators and volunteers. I believe these measures would ensure a consistent standard and accountability for all persons who undertake the coaching role, which then form a sturdy foundation for the sports scene in Singapore to thrive.'], ['Prof Koh Lian Pin', 'Chairman, at first glance sports and sustainability may seem to be two very different arenas. However, there may be opportunities for collaboration between the two sectors and communities for mutual benefit and the benefit of all Singaporeans. For example, in July last year, ActiveSG launched the permanent programme to collect and recycle used sports shoes into construction material for jogging tracks and fitness corners. Could the Ministry share what additional initiatives are being considered to promote sustainability in sports?'], ['Mr Xie Yao Quan', \"Chairman, I would like to speak briefly about sports today – the role of sports in our lives and in our community. And I would like to start by recalling Minister Edwin Tong's response to one of my Parliamentary Questions recently. In his response, Minister laid out very comprehensively the overall framework – of our sporting system, sporting programmes and sporting infrastructure – and at various levels, from sports in the community, to sporting performance at the highest level. And his response reminded me then that sports is a little bit like clean air in our lives; we tend to forget that it is there, until it is no longer there. But I think through years of effort, we have built up a framework that has allowed sports to become so integral – a part of our lives and our community here in Singapore. It is in this spirit that I raise two questions, around what more we can do to strengthen the role of sports in our lives and our community. First, on inclusive sports. Sports has the power to uplift and empower individuals. It uplifts the spirit, it allows for the display and expression of talent and flair, it can help a person discover him or herself. By extension, sports has the power to uplift and empower whole segments in society – more vulnerable children, youths at risk, persons with disabilities, seniors. It can transform lives. The Delta League by the Home Team is a good example. And SportSG has also launched the SportCares programme. So, can MCCY share its future plans on its SportCares programme, so that we can continue to grow a movement of inclusive sports to transform lives in Singapore? Chairman, second, on high-performance sports. As Singaporeans, we cheer our national athletes on when they compete, we celebrate with them when they win and partake in their disappointment when they do not. But I think we will reach the next level in our high-performance sporting culture here in Singapore when we can go beyond spectatorship, transcend spectatorship, to be an active part of the system and an active part of the movement. And in this respect, MCCY has created a One Team Singapore Fund (OTSF), where individuals and corporates can make donations with dollar-for-dollar matching by the Government. Can MCCY share its future plans on this Fund, so that we can continue to encourage a spirit of giving towards high performance sports in Singapore?\"], ['Ms Rahayu Mahzam', \"In 2021, our para athletes shone on the world stage. For the 2020 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo, Team Singapore fielded 10 athletes across six sports, to compete with the world's best and represent Singapore at the highest sporting showcase. In October last year, this House resolved a Motion to congratulate Team Singapore Olympians and Paralympians for their achievements. For the Bahrain Asian Youth Para Games, Singapore sent 13 athletes and the amazing team made the nation proud by bringing back five gold, three silver and two bronze medals. Our para athletes have been an inspiration to us all. They show us what it means to defy the odds and what is possible when you are not defined or constrained by physical limitations. We can and should draw from their example to encourage more participation in sports in Singapore, especially among persons with disabilities (PWDs). I am happy to hear about the Para Sport Academy but beyond the high performance sporting participation, we should look at how we can facilitate regular participation in sport activities by improving access and creating more opportunities for PWDs to be involved. There are many good reasons for this. For one, sport activities are a good way to keep healthy. We heard yesterday at the MOH COS debate about preventive health and physical activity is an important component of a healthy lifestyle. Sport activities not only help with physical wellness but also mental well-being as participants interact with others and build relationships through their interactions. Secondly, sports can be so empowering for PWDs. With facilitation and proper guidance, PWDs can acquire useful social skills and build up their confidence as they participate in sport activities that they enjoy. Thirdly, there is so much potential to promote inclusiveness through sports. Sports is a social leveller that does not distinguish between educational levels, socio-economic status, race or religion. It helps bring together people from all walks of life. We can support and cheer for each other and use common facilities together. This would help normalise different abilities and open doors to better appreciation and understanding of differences. I note that there have been efforts on this front. There is a Disability Sports Master Plan in place setting the roadmap for various initiatives. There are inclusive gyms and several disability sports programmes and also efforts by SportsSG. I also understand that various stakeholders like Singapore Disability Sports Council and MOE work with SportsSG to enable talent development in disability sports and strengthen capabilities in the ecosystem. I would like to understand if we have been tracking our progress. Have there been developments on inclusive physical exercise and disability sports programmes? Is knowledge and expertise in tailoring sports activities for PWDs and organising inclusive sports programmes sufficiently widespread? I hope the Ministry can share its plans to leverage on sports to make Singapore a more inclusive society. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about much disruption and challenges to all, including our youth. Our young people had to contend with significant changes in their educational journey and there was a particularly specific impact for those who were in certain courses of study or at the tail end of their formal education. They had to quickly adjust to learning online, with less interaction with teachers and other students. It was especially challenging for those in technical courses where hands-on learning is important. Internship programmes had to be adjusted as firms implemented work-from-home arrangements. Those who had planned to study overseas or go for an exchange programme had their plans disrupted. Prospects for some industries appeared bleak as the economy pivoted and some wondered about their choice of study and career prospects. This caused much anxiety and uncertainty. Some young people I spoke to expressed how the pandemic robbed them of their opportunities and youth. The impact on their mental well-being was indeed significant. According to the NYC Youth Statistics in Brief 2020, the youth labour force participation rates for the year 2019 was 61% for ages 20 to 24; 90.1% for ages 25 to 29; 92.3% for ages 30 to 34. According to the MOM report in June 2021, the youth unemployment rate climbed in 2020. Annual average resident youth unemployment rate hit 10.6%, 1.8% higher than during the 2009 global financial crisis and 1.3% higher than during the 2003 SARS pandemic. While the situation is challenging for those transiting from school to work, I feel that our youth have shown a lot of resilience in overcoming their situation. There may be industries affected but there are many opportunities abound and new growth areas. It is important, therefore, to strategically look at how we can support youth to seize the opportunities and provide them with the relevant insights so that they are motivated and have the necessary information to make decisions for their future. Mentors, especially in growth sectors, can play a meaningful role in this effort. I am a strong believer in mentoring. I support the efforts of Mentoring Alliance Singapore and oversee the youth empowerment and mentoring programmes under M3. I do not think I need to extol the virtues of mentoring to this House. We all know the value of having that someone in your life to give guidance and motivation as you venture into new unknown and challenging areas. I would like though, to emphasise the importance of mentoring in opening world views and nudging young people to explore possibilities. This is especially significant for families of certain economic status, where their children do not benefit from the social capital of those who are more well-to-do or well-connected. Their world view may be circumscribed by what they see their parents do. Even if they get inspired by someone they read or hear about in the news, they do not know how to get there, how to achieve the same things. Given the current evolution of the economy post-pandemic, it is timely, in fact more urgent now, to train people from various growing industries to become mentors. Further, not everyone is as fortunate to meet a mentor who can guide her along. We need to make sure that every young person has access to the support she needs. There are a lot more programmes and opportunities now as compared to the time when I was in school. We could continue to improve on this by creating an ecosystem and culture of mentoring in Singapore. That way, every young person will have access to mentors and when they grow older, may be mentors themselves. Aside from educational development and career prospects, it is important to also look into the emotional development and resilience of youth. There is a lot of awareness now about mental well-being and its impact on the holistic development of an individual. We should garner the insights and build that in as part of the training of mentors or mentoring programmes. I, therefore, hope that MCCY can look at efforts to develop a more strategic and current mentoring framework for our youth. I believe with these efforts, we can continue to encourage our youth to be resilient and hopeful for the future.\"], ['Ms Hany Soh', 'Chairman, as part of the Government\\'s overall efforts to secure a sustainable future for Singapore, can MCCY elaborate on its plans to ensure a greener and more sustainable sports ecosystem? In my previous green, sustainability-related Parliamentary speeches, I have shared my firm belief that community involvement plays a vital role in our overall nations efforts towards SG Green Plan 2030 through our collective efforts and embracing an eco-friendly lifestyle and greenify the environment. In order to achieve that, the Government needs to set up the right hardware and co-create the green software. Active SG Woodlands Sports Centre situated in our Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC is one such example. A community farm was actually set up right next to its swimming pool and is being cared for by a team of passionate Team Nila Volunteers as well as members of the public living around the vicinity of Marsiling and Woodgrove. The ground-up recycling effort at this community farm is commendable. Most of the fittings there are actually recycled items contributed and creatively put together by residents and ActiveSG staff. They have also exhibited their innovativeness by harvesting rainwater to irrigate the greens. These green farming activities not only keep the members active and fit but also build a strong kampong spirit as they routinely contribute the harvest to the vulnerable groups in our community along with sharing their green tips to other community gardens within the neighbourhood. Are there any other plans for Sport SG to roll out up similar green concepts to other sports centres across Singapore? How else does MCCY intend to involve the sports community, Singaporeans and partners from the private sectors to co-create solutions for sustainability and play a part in these efforts. Minister Edwin Tong has previously shared in his views that our young people are a crucial segment of our society. The youths of today are the leaders of tomorrow. I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister. Our youths are the people who must have a say in the kind of society they want to be in it and should play an active role in shaping Singapore\\'s future. Youths today, however, faced many uncertainties, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic and other global issues. Many of them are also in transitions through different life stages. These have placed a significant amount of stress on our young people, especially in areas such as job prospects, finances and mental well-being. Despite these challenges, we have witnessed many of them will have tirelessly volunteered their time and effort in serving the vulnerable groups in our community during this eventful period. I am particularly grateful to the youths in our Woodgrove community. Despite facing their own challenges, they have organised mental wellness talks to motivate others to stay positive, distributed \"Return to School\" care packs to low-income group children, hosted upcycling \"Go Green\" workshops and planned many clean-up estate initiatives to raise empathy for our cleaners. Can MCCY share what is done to support youths\\' concerns and needs in their key priority areas? How does the whole Government intend to work together to support youths in navigating their various life stages and transitions? What has also been done to provide opportunities and support to our youths of different cultures and backgrounds to continue contributing to the community and mold the future of our Singapore, despite the present challenges that each of them may be facing now?'], ['Ms Tin Pei Ling', 'Chairman, a young resident of mine, only 23 years old, committed suicide in June last year. He was a good boy who was always giving, always there to support his peers, to counsel and encourage them to not take their lives. But he himself struggled. He studied in an Arts school and did not take a conventional path. His graduation coincided with the pandemic. His enlistment was affected as the date for enlistment was unclear back then; he could not plan his life and did not know what he could do. He applied for jobs but could not secure any, partly due to his specialisation and partly due to the uncertainty of when he had to start serving NS. The future felt bleak to him. Finally, he jumped down the block. I saw him not too long before he took his life, as I had only just given out an Edusave award to his sibling. I was at his wake, saw his mother and spoke with his friends who all missed him very dearly. It was absolutely heartbreaking. Imagine the pain the mummy was feeling. So, youths today face many uncertainties and pressures – ranging from body image to grades, to relationships and to whether they have a future. These are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many youths are also in transition through different life stages. Even adults have arguably having a few hard knocks in life already struggle when hit with a crisis, what more for youths. Mental well-being has now come to the fore. It used to be a topic brushed away and shunned by many. I spoke on this for years in Parliament and when I was an undergraduate. People hardly wanted to talk about it. But now, we are forced to come face to face with it as we endure the pandemic, but thankfully, there is now a general public will to address it. I know stress is not something one can legislate away. But the Government can direct resources through the right channels in a timely manner to help our youths through difficult times, to help build their resilience. Some of the stress could be mitigated by guiding them in the right direction such as proactive career counselling and matching, and timely intervention to stop physical or online bullying. But often times, it is also about letting them know that they are not alone, that there is someone or groups of people whom they can turn to for a listening ear, for positive affirmation, for advice and to nudge them to embrace a growth mindset. That someone may not always be a family member and that is ok, the school and community must be ready. And we must also be mindful to avoid coming across as patronising but sincere in wanting to help. So, I would like to ask how is the Government supporting our youths in overcoming the challenges they face and achieving their aspirations? Our youths are our future. They must not feel hopeless and helpless. How will the whole-of-Government therefore, work together to be present in their lives, to give and show support to our youths as they transition from one stage to the next?'], ['The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Alvin Tan)', 'Mr Chairman, Minister Edwin Tong spoke about our transition out of the pandemic – to build towards a strong, caring, and inclusive Singapore. Our national monuments embody our foundational values, and where we come from. Elgin Bridge, located just next to this House, is one of them. It quietly symbolises our openness to the world, our strength in diversity, our adaptability for the future. It symbolically connected Singapore and the world, through facilitating trade for our city’s growth. It connected the culturally different towns of our Indian and Chinese migrants living on South Bridge Road, to the Malay and European community living across on North Bridge Road. The Elgin Bridge that we walk on today, is a result of four major reconstructions over two centuries, adapting to the times of our society. Elgin Bridge continues to bear witness to our Singapore story – where we build connections with the world, re-invent ourselves for the future, bridge our differences, and forge a shared identity amidst our diversity. Mr Chairman, I will first touch on our youths, who will realise our future. Together with them, we will continue to build bridges to the world, towards our shared future vision of Singapore, and with one another. I chat regularly with our youths, and two issues that they deeply care about are the future of work and mental well-being. I will focus on both. Ms Hany Soh asked how we can better support our youths, especially in their jobs, finances, and mental well-being. Our youths know they need to prepare themselves for their future careers and desire three things: (a) opportunities to learn, (b) concrete skills to offer, and (c) guidance along the way. That is why we are building bridges to our region and beyond, to help them to seize new opportunities. For example, we are building bridges all the way with Latin America – a region with immense growth potential, to help Singapore startups enter. Singapore established an MOU with Colombia, and a partnership with venture capital (VC) firm, Latin Leap, to promote closer collaboration with companies in Latin America, especially in areas of Artificial Intelligence, fintech and sustainability. Our youths who are setting their sights beyond Singapore can therefore look forward to more global opportunities. During the Budget Debates, Mr Desmond Choo referred to our youths as \"Generation COVID-19\" – coming of age during the pandemic, in an era of many opportunities, but also, unique challenges. Our youths need the confidence to seize opportunities by acquiring concrete skills and knowledge, and we have developed three initiatives on this. First, our Asia-Ready Exposure Programme (AEP) helps bridge our youths to the region. Through online content and physical trips when possible, we are developing our youths’ cross-cultural skills for opportunities in Asia. Our AEP recently collaborated with the Ministry of Trade and Industry Academy on a webinar programme titled \"Regional Economies and Trade\", to equip our youths with insights on market economies, like ASEAN, China and India. Our youths learnt first-hand from industry leaders in Asia, from companies like Quest Ventures, a top VC fund in Asia, YCH Group, a leading regional supply chain management partner, and Riverwalk Holdings – an India-focused VC fund, on what it is like to work abroad, and what skills you need to succeed in the region. Second, we are creating opportunities to bridge our youths to local organisations, in the community and social sectors. At the height of COVID-19, we rolled out our Youth Corps Internship Scheme, which provided more than 700 youths with internship experiences since September 2020. We will build on this as we recover from the pandemic. Through the Youth Corps Community Internship (YCCI), MCCY and NYC will partner social and community organisations to offer internships, with priority given to ITE and the Polytechnics. Our youths can pick up skills like event and project management, marketing and community engagement. Third, we will build and strengthen bridges for our youths, with mentors, as they navigate life\\'s many milestones. Ms. Rahayu Mahzam’s question about mentoring opportunities to support our youths emotionally is thus key. Mentoring will play a key part in the upstream. That is why we launched our Mentoring Alliance for Action (AfA) last year, to build a stronger mentoring culture in Singapore, especially for youths undergoing life\\'s many transitions, be it from school-to-work, or when switching careers. So, to any youth looking for a mentor, the Mentoring AfA has established WeConnect, Singapore’s first dedicated online mentoring platform, where you can find programmes, ranging from mentoring opportunities, to community groups, for your personal life-stages. Through WeConnect, you can connect with a pool of over 1,000 volunteer mentors, which is growing, coming from companies like P&G, Unilever, and Meta. You can learn from mentors who have traversed career journeys across industries like tech, logistics, media. By the end of this month, you can register on WeConnect. And I highly encourage you to do so. Next, building bridges of mutual support. Ms Tin Pei Ling asked how we are supporting youths struggling with mental health. During the Budget Debates, Dr Shahira Abdullah and Ms Nadia Samdin stressed the importance of stronger mental health support in Singapore. I agree with them. Even as the pandemic wanes, mental health issues will not just disappear with it. We need to reinforce support for our youths. We want our youths to know that it is okay to reach out and share about their mental health and well-being without fear of judgement. To build supportive communities, we will expand peer support networks across various settings, be it in schools, workplaces, online and in the community. MCCY and NYC are partnering with our Youth Sector Organisations, like Campus Psy and Young NTUC, to run peer support network programmes. We are also encouraging trained peer supporters from ITE, Polytechnics and Universities to continue serving the community after graduation, by joining our Youth Corps Singapore. And our youths are leading the way on mental health awareness. The Happiness Initiative, Calm Collective and Limitless, are just three of the many ground-up initiatives they are spearheading. And to bring together these efforts, the Government started our Youth Mental Well-being Network in 2020. Since then, more than 1,500 individuals, comprising youths, parents, caregivers, mental health professionals started more than 20 ground-up projects to support youth mental well-being. But mental health issues do not only affect our youths. So, to achieve even greater impact, we will expand the efforts of the YMWBN to a broader network, which will tackle mental health issues across a broader range of population segments, as mentioned by Senior Minister of State Janil in his speech. This wider network will be a platform for those who can deliver mental health and well-being outcomes, like Campus Psy and Calm Collective, to come together and spearhead initiatives, with funding support. For those who would benefit from these initiatives, the Network could help you find useful services and initiatives more easily. So, whether you are an organisation, a student, a middle aged PMET, or senior looking for mental well-being support, we welcome you to be part of this effort. MCCY will support this network, which will be advised by the Inter-agency Taskforce for Mental Health and Well-being. I feel privileged to chair this network with the support of my colleagues Minister of State Sun Xueling and Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu Mahzam. We will announce more details later this year. We have learnt a lot from the Youth Mental Well-being Network and we will build upon the learnings and networks to build a more inclusive Singapore that prioritises our mental well-being. Next, we must look ahead, or construct new bridges to our desired future, with our youths. At MCCY, we have already begun the work and are now seeing the early fruits of our labour through the Youth Action Challenge (YAC) and the Somerset Belt. Through the YAC, any youth with an idea, and a desire to tackle the problems of our day, can pitch their innovative project idea, and receive grants to realise these solutions. Since 2019, we have worked with over 700 youths, who have formed more than 170 project teams, to tackle societal issues ranging from environment and sustainability, to support for vulnerable groups. Many of their projects have made tangible impact. Take for example the team Skilio, founded by our youths Felix, Dody and Zhi Hui, with a simple but ambitious vision: creating a society where we are recognised for our unique strengths – not defined by the schools we go to, or the letters on our report cards. Skilio puts these ideals into a tangible product – a digital portfolio that help youths document any soft skills picked up along their educational journey, to pursue their dream careers. With YAC’s support, Skilio has expanded its offerings, giving our youths free access to build these portfolios, and connects them to companies based on their unique qualities and skillsets. Thus far, over 5,000 students across 11 different schools and organisations have joined Skilio, with the potential to scale. This reflects how our youths’ ideas can, and indeed have made an impact, and indeed, a difference to many. We are also offering our youths a dedicated physical space to prototype their ideas, and implement ground-up programs for social causes through our Somerset Belt. Since 2019, Somerset Belt has supported more than 20 ground-up projects, reaching more than 20,000 youths on causes like arts, environment and more. In the year ahead, we will partner institutes like Singapore Polytechnic and Singapore University of Technology and Design to translate ideas from classrooms and studios into real life. We will also refresh and enhance the spaces within Somerset Belt in the coming years. Thus far, we have sought ideas from over 240 youths on how they envision or want to use this space. Some envision the Belt to be a Creative Hub, with experimental retail spaces. We will continue to grow and make our youth-initiated ideas come alive through funding support. We will announce more details on the refresh works on the Somerset Belt later this year. Mr Chairman, we have already seen early fruits from the YAC and the Somerset Belt. In time, especially with the upcoming YAC Season 4 starting October, we will see even more youths coming forward to make their impact, and in fact, I welcome youths to come and join our YAC Season 4. Mr Chairman, I would like to speak in Mandarin, please.'], ['The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Alvin Tan)', 'Mr Koh Lian Pin asked about other plans for youths to take action on social causes. We will continue to empower our youths to make a difference, starting from where they live. We will expand and provide 1,500 locale-based volunteering opportunities through Youth Corp Singapore (YCS)’s partnership with SG Cares Volunteer Centres, SSO ComLink, and other social service agencies. We will match our youths to neighbours in need, to support underprivileged families, senior citizens, and more. Combined with locale-based offerings, YCS offers a total of 7,500 opportunities where any youth, with a heart to serve, can step forward to bridge gaps in our society.'], ['The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Alvin Tan)', 'I will next talk about building our youths’ civic capacity for constructive discourse with one another. Today, with tech and social media as the frontiers for social discourse, we need to strengthen mutual understanding, especially on key and contentious societal issues. While we see more open discussions on social media, we also see growing polarisation, echo chambers and the rise of cancel culture. When I spoke with youths at the launch of the Inter-University Network last month, they shared with me their wish to discuss difficult and controversial issues frankly. They want to work with us to build what they call safe spaces and also guardrails to do so. That is why Mr Koh Lian Pin’s question about opportunities for youth participation on topics of national interest is key and relevant and timely. We will work with our youths to create safe platforms for them to explore and engage in a diversity of views, and help them build empathy towards those who hold different views. From April to September this year, the National Youth Council will partner Mediacorp to launch a digital engagement campaign called \"Civic Conversations\". We will highlight important norms and values that should guide our conversations and create spaces for respectful and deep dialogue. We will address key topics like race and religion, local-foreigner relations and inter-generational bonding. Our youths can participate in a variety of online platforms like Instagram Live! sessions with expert panels and access the content through a microsite. They will pick up useful tips on how to engage in difficult conversations and converse constructively on complex issues. Mr Chairman, we must consciously strengthen the bridges that connect us, not just across the diversity of our perspectives but also across our different racial, religious and ethnic backgrounds. Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman asked about our integration efforts to build a cohesive society and bridge societal fault lines. In addition to the work of our Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs) as covered by Minister Edwin Tong, our National Integration Council and Singapore Citizenship Journey are important platforms for this. Both platforms help us to strengthen the bridges between locals and newcomers to Singapore. We must never forget that Singapore\\'s story has always been one of an immigrant nation embracing diversity and being open to the world. As part of our Emerging Stronger Conversations, members of the National Integration Council (NIC) candidly discussed challenges around local-foreigner relations, particularly arising from COVID-19. We developed three key themes that the NIC\\'s Alliance for Action and its projects will focus on. First, to create more shared experiences and interactions through a community orientation programme and volunteering opportunities where newcomers and locals can have meaningful interactions. Second, to share positive stories that inspire us to embrace the vibrancy of our diverse backgrounds and common aspirations. Third, to empower and equip more to speak up on sensitive issues relating to diversity and inclusion by developing workshops and programmes. Together, 20 representatives from 15 different community groups, corporations and grassroot organisations will co-create and drive these projects. Everyone can play a part in this effort. The efforts of the IRCCs and the NIC emphasise our shared Singaporean identity. But what does it mean to be Singaporean and to live in Singapore? Through our Citizens\\' Workgroup for Singapore Citizenship Journey (SCJ) in 2020, Singaporeans answered this question. They reflected that it is our shared languages and experience. It is how we order kopi with our uniquely Singaporean language, whether it is \"kopi-o\" or \"kopi-c\" or \"kopi peng\". It is our community spirit and shared values where we believe it is our responsibility to care for one another and to leave no one behind. Thanks to our citizens\\' contributions, we have included refreshed content in our e-Journey and new e-Book, such as our arts and culture and aspirations for Singapore\\'s future. You can experience the e-Journey now through the Singapore Journey website and look forward to the launch of the e-Book next month, titled \"Welcome to Singapore\". I hope these resources remind us about the heart of being a Singaporean. Mr Chairman, in Malay, please.'], ['The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Alvin Tan)', \"Mr Chairman, our IRCC, NIC and SCJ strengthen the ties between our different ethnic and religious communities. The solidarity they foster, is our nation's source of strength, which we must not take for granted. Walking across Elgin Bridge towards South Bridge Road, we can see how our diversity exists in harmony. Along this one road, we have the Masjid Jamae Chulia, Sri Mariamman Temple, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and the Fairfield Methodist Church. This is the diversity that our forefathers built our nation on. By building stronger bridges across communities, our diversity will continue to be our defining strength.\"], ['The Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Alvin Tan)', 'Mr Chairman, Minister Edwin Tong reminded us that our transition out of the pandemic will not be without obstacles. Great cities, including strong bridges, were not built in a day nor by a single person or group. This mirrors the words that our former president, Mr Yusof Ishak said more than 50 years ago, \"In every brick, stone, stool that makes up Singapore, there is contained the effort and energies of generations of men, starting with the early immigrants. The whole fabric of Singapore society is woven out of the thread of human effort, labour and purpose.\" As we embark on the next arc of our Singapore story, it is now our time, our turn, to build on these foundations and create new bridges to the world, towards our shared future and with one other.'], ['The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Eric Chua)', 'Chairman, COVID-19 has changed the way we live, work and play. These past two plus years, we have had to fight the pandemic together, yet acutely apart. This long fight has been draining. But like other crises we have weathered before, we can overcome COVID-19. But to do so, we must strengthen the sense of \"us\". I will now outline how MCCY will build a more caring, inclusive and united society through volunteerism and sports. Ms Hany Soh and Prof Koh Lian Pin asked about efforts to build a more sustainable sport ecosystem. We are doing so in three ways. First, we are greening our sport infrastructure like the upcoming Punggol Regional Sport Centre in 2024 and the Kallang Alive Precinct into a sports and recreational Green Mark District. Second, we are partnering the sport industry to reduce, recondition and recycle sport equipment. SportSG will ensure that all its supported events attain green certification by 2023. Third, we will rally our National Sports Associations (NSAs), Team Nila volunteers and ActiveSG Sport Centres to amplify our sustainability efforts. We have brought community gardens like the one Ms Hany Soh described to other ActiveSG Sport Centres to cultivate community ties through green initiatives. Mr Mohd Fahmi Bin Aliman and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked about opportunities for Singaporeans to volunteer and to care for others. Through the SG Cares movement, MCCY will work with community partners to make volunteerism our way of life. First, SG Cares is partnering professional bodies such as the Law Society Pro Bono Services to champion skills-based volunteerism. We aim to grow regular volunteers and deepen our culture of care and service to the community within these professional bodies. Second, in every town, the SG Cares Volunteer Centres (VCs) and SG Cares Community Networks are fostering collaborations with partners such as schools, corporates, ground-up movements and Social Service Agencies (SSAs) to channel volunteers to areas of need. Third, we will continue to enhance our charities\\' capabilities. As shared by the Finance Minister, we will extend the Charities Capability Fund from FY2022 to FY2026. Charities and Institutions of a Public Character will continue to receive funding support to strengthen their governance and management capabilities. Lastly, we have made volunteering even more accessible through the SSAs and SG Cares VCs, which have pivoted to virtual volunteering opportunities such as online storytelling and exercise sessions that engage diverse age groups. Mr Xie Yao Quan rightly pointed out that sport has the power to uplift underserved communities and change lives. Indeed, sport is a powerful force for good and a great social leveller. SportSG\\'s SportCares will partner MSF\\'s ComLink, to offer programmes like its flagship \"Saturday Night Lights\", a structured football programme, to families with children and youth living in rental housing. This will be launched to all 21 ComLink towns, but starting with five this year. We hope to reach out to 28,000 children and youths across about 300 public rental housing blocks by 2027. Sport also plays a critical developmental role for youths. It shapes character, teaches resilience and teamwork and builds communities. SportCares will launch two initiatives. First, a mentorship programme. I agree with Ms Rahayu Mahzam. Having mentored ITE students myself for many years, I strongly believe that every youth has potential, regardless of what their starting points in life is. In addition to WeConnect that Minister of State Alvin Tan mentioned earlier, SportCares has launched a mentoring programme to support 100 disadvantaged young people over the next two years. Second, we will support our youths through internships, scholarships and bursaries. From July, SportCares will offer industry attachments within SportSG and industry partners. SportCares has also committed $400,000 towards the SportCares Scholarship. Up to 20 SportCares youths will be supported to pursue either a NITEC, tertiary or undergraduate course in a locally recognised institution. Up to 1,400 children, youths and persons with disabilities (PwDs) from low-income backgrounds will benefit from the SportCares Bursary Scheme, which covers the fees to any ActiveSG Academies and Clubs programme for at least a season of 10 weeks. Mr Darryl David, Ms Rahayu Mahzam and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked about efforts to provide more inclusive opportunities through sports. In my MSF speech earlier, I spoke about the Enabling Masterplan 2030 and our whole-of-society efforts to make Singapore more inclusive. To that end, disability sport plays an important role. Since the launch of the Disability Sports Masterplan (DSMP) in 2016, we have made good progress. We widened the base of disability sport participation. The number of PwDs participating in sport has grown from one in three in 2016 to one in two today. We will made our sport facilities more accessible and will make all ActiveSG Gyms inclusive by 2026. We have also promoted inclusion through sharing sporting experiences. Mr Mark Chay raised the importance of empowering coaches to better support PwDs. Ms Rahayu Mahzam asked if expertise in this area is sufficiently widespread. Today, CoachSG runs curated coaching courses under the Special Olympics Singapore and Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC). About 2,800 coaches, educators, volunteers, staff and students have been trained in inclusive sport programmes. To equip more coaches with disability sport coaching competencies, CoachSG will incorporate this into the National Registry of Coaches\\' (NROC) SG-Coach Level Two curriculum this year. In summary, the DSMP has benefited more than 18,000 persons with disabilities to date. We will continue to do this and more. This year, SportSG will introduce 10 sport programmes under the new Para Sport Academy, starting with Cerebral Palsy Football, Para-canoe and Athletics. The Para Sport Academy will drive the integration of disability and mainstream sports in our ActiveSG Academies and Clubs. They will also provide aspiring para-athletes a clear pathway from recreational participation to high-performance sport. We hope that the Para Sport Academy will be an enabling platform through which more persons with disabilities can build their self-confidence and reach their fullest potential. It is also our ambition to grow a new generation of para-athletes who will go on to represent Singapore. To better ensure that the Para Sport Academy serves the needs of para-athletes, SportSG has established an advisory panel comprising prominent members of the disability sport community. With their extensive experience in and contributions to para sports, the panel will be well placed to co-design and grow the Para Sport Academy. Mr Mark Chay spoke about raising coaching standards and recognising coaches. On raising coaching standards and regulations, SportSG is working on creating a larger national registry to include coaches and fitness instructors. Under the Safe Coach Programme that is being rolled out, all sport participants in member organisations, including administrators and volunteers will be bound by the Safe Sport Unified Code. Mr Mark Chay also asked about the Coaching Competency Framework that CoachSG is developing with Leeds Beckett University. This will inform our formal coach education curriculum. When recognised as part of the sport sector Industry Transformation Map coaches can use the framework to compare the competencies and remuneration of coaching against jobs in adjacent sectors, thereby promoting greater occupational mobility. With established recommended rates, coaches will be remunerated fairly and it is our hope that the coaching profession will become more attractive. On recognising our coaches, today there are various awards such as the Coach of the Year Award by the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) and SDSC as well as CoachSG\\'s Singapore Coach Medallion. I thank Mr Mark Chay on his interest on various issues and welcome him to continue working closely with us. Madam, 2020 will be yet another busy year for our Team Singapore athletes, as they represent Singapore at the Hanoi SEA Games, the Birmingham Commonwealth Games, the Surakarta ASEAN Para Games and the Hangzhou Asian and Asian Para Games. Keeping in top form will be of utmost importance and Mr Mark Chay will be reassured to know that we are supporting our athletes, best as we can. Our support for national athletes is comprehensive and takes both financial and non-financial forms. Each year, the Government spends more than $70 million in high performance sport, over and above the $90 million on sport infrastructure. Funding support for major games is also planned in advance and accounted for within the NSA\\'s multi-year sports plan. We also continually invest resources to enhance the Singapore Sport Institute (SSI) and the National Youth Sport Institute (NYSI). Today, both have quality infrastructure to provide sport science and medicine support to our national athletes. Whether it is access to funding, sport science or medicine, the support rendered to each athlete is customised based on individual needs, and specific demands of their sport. On National Service, the priority of full-time National Servicemen is their military duties. We are working with MINDEF to support our Team Singapore athletes to address their sport training needs while fulfilling military duties. Provisions like short-term deferment, leave and time-off to train and compete are available, subject to the SAF\\'s operational needs. Corporates and Singaporeans can also contribute to our athletes\\' journeys. Mr Xie Yao Quan asked about the One Team Singapore Fund (OTSF) and efforts to encourage a spirit of giving to sports. Mr Darryl David asked about efforts to rally Singaporeans to support Team Singapore. As previously announced by the Finance Minister, we are extending the $50 million OTSF Matching Grant for an additional five years until FY2026 and to cover more areas of high performance sport support. The OTSF offers one-to-one matching for donations and has matched almost $15 million since its inception in 2017. Your donations and matching grant will benefit our athletes. We will also establish Team Singapore Cares, a platform for Team Singapore athletes, to serve and give back. Team Singapore athletes will be able to tap on the Active Citizen Grant to spearhead initiatives. SportSG will also support them to connect them with Corporate Partners who can help to co-fund these projects. Finally, football. I thank Miss Cheng Li Hui, Mr Darryl David, Mr Abdul Samad and Mr Faisal Manap for your passion in Singapore football. Allow me to provide an update on the progress on Unleash the Roar!, our national project to uplift Singapore football. This year, we started 10 School Football Academies (SFAs) in Secondary schools. We want to provide a nurturing environment for students to hone their football skills while supporting them academically. Almost 400 students have enrolled in our SFAs. Our ambition is to grow them to full capacity over the next few years with a total of 16 SFAs for boys across all Secondary levels. And we also plan to establish SFAs for girls as well. A key factor in the SFAs’ success is quality coaching. To give our students the best training environment, each SFA will feature a dedicated Head Coach, assistant coaches and zonal specialist coaches. To go far, we must work with the right partners. We are working with LaLiga to bring in nine Head Coaches who have experience developing young, high performance footballers to lead our SFAs. These coaches will join us in April. We are also partnering Borussia Dortmund, a top professional football club in the Bundesliga, famed for its focus on youth talent development. We are also grooming our local coaches. We have begun recruiting local assistant coaches. Five have started coaching since mid-January, and we will onboard 12 more by April. To ensure high quality football coaching, more than 300 coaches and MOE teachers have also been trained to adopt our National Football Curriculum. Unleash the Roar! is a project committed to levelling up Singapore football for the long haul. Beyond youth and coach development, we will set into motion other plans. First, we will launch the Unleash the Roar! scholarship to nurture young talents later this year. The scholarship will provide financial support to talented and committed footballers to immerse themselves in a high-performance football environment abroad while pursuing their studies. We also plan to support more young talents to go overseas on stints to broaden their exposure. Second, we will do more for women’s football here in Singapore. We will grow the participation base by introducing more programmes for girls under the ActiveSG Football Academy. We will provide our women footballers greater support by way of training facilities, coaching and sport science. Third, beyond the resumption of the Singapore Premier League (SPL), MCCY and SportSG have been working with partners such as the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) on opportunities for our football teams to compete with international teams on home ground. Singaporeans can look forward to supporting the Lions at the upcoming football triangular series against the Philippines and Malaysia. I am sure some Members of the House also fondly recall the Lion City Cup. Pandemic restrictions aside, we hope to bring our young competitors from the region into Singapore, so our youths can compete at a high level, and at the same time, generate excitement about youth football. Finally, we are in discussions with FAS to transform the SPL by increasing professional standards and strengthening private sponsorship. We look forward to sharing more when these plans are firmed up. Mr Faisal Manap asked about the replacement of our national coach. I understand the FAS\\' recruitment process for this position has been set in motion and we will hear from them in due course. Sir, Unleash the Roar! is a mammoth undertaking. Many have asked me how I felt, leading the charge on this front. I would be lying if I said I do not have butterflies in my stomach. But today, I am hopeful. Why? Because of the many passionate individuals I had spent hours talking to about this project. Because they believe in Singapore football. And because of our Lions, the way they fought their Indonesian rivals at the Suzuki Cup semi-finals last year on Christmas Day! And most of all because of how Singaporeans reacted to them. What we witnessed that night has got to be one of the most, if not the most gripping Singapore football performance in recent history. We all rallied behind our Lions. The immense sense of pride that I felt, correction, we felt, when Majulah Singapura filled the National Stadium – never mind that there were only 10,000 of us that evening. That experience was simply priceless. That, Members of this Chamber, is the power of sport, the power of football and that is why we must believe in Singapore football and we must believe that we can Unleash the Roar! Sir, I began by talking about the importance of strengthening our collective sense of “us\". I would like to end by saying that we are laying the foundations for a better future today. Across our different sectors – community, arts, sports, youth – we all have a role to play in shaping a Singapore that is caring, cohesive and confident. It is our strength in unity and collective fortitude that will enable us to overcome the pandemic and build a brighter tomorrow, and a stronger Singapore Together.'], ['Ms Hany Soh', \"Thank you, Chairman. This clarification is in relation to Youth Corp Community Internship (YCCI), which Minister of State Alvin Tan had shared with us earlier on the internship opportunities for youth in the social and community sectors in Singapore. I wish to enquire whether we can consider extending it to overseas opportunities in this aspect as well. One example is a youth exchange programme organised previously by the Central CDC under its High 5 Youth initiative many years ago, which I personally benefited as a student leader. Awardees participate in the exchange programme in countries such as Australia and Xiamen, China to better understand the local community's good practices on matters, such as inter-generational bonding, and put them into practice when they return to Singapore.\"], ['Mr Alvin Tan', 'I thank the Member for her clarification. The YCCI programme is one of many different programmes and it is starting in the second quarter of this year. But I wanted to let the Member know that we have other programmes and one of the most appropriate ones is called the Youth Expedition Project (YEP), which is run by Youth Corp Singapore for youths to, in fact, do what exactly the Member mentioned – to serve other communities overseas. Pre-COVID-19 we sent about four to five thousand youths every year for two-week community service stints with overseas youth organisations. The YEP programme usually spans about four to six months if you factor in preparation planning as well as post-trip reflections. We intend to restart YEP. We have it online now, so it is YEP Go Online. This is not as ideal as we would love to because nothing beats being there physically, but we plan to restart it very soon, hopefully, when travel resumes. The other programme is the Asia Exposure Ready Programme (AEP), which will expand support to travel-based programmes, when it is possible, for a more experiential and more community-based experience for youth overseas. So, we have these programmes in place and we hope to restart these programmes when travel resumes.'], ['Mr Mark Chay', 'Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would just like to make two clarifications. One is to ask the Minister about the establishment of gaming, digital content and technology hub and the second is on the Para Sport Academy. How many athletes will it impact? At what level will it impact? And what are the tangible goals to understand what the success of this Para Sport Academy will look like?'], ['Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai', \"I thank the Member Mr Chay for his questions. To deal with his first point, Mr Chay might be pleased to know that we have been working with partners such as the Global Sport Innovation Centre (GSIC), and just a few months back in December last year, GSIC launched the Asia Pacific HQ in Singapore. Having partners like GSIC in Singapore means that we will aggregate the thought leadership in Singapore. As you know, with gaming, technology and innovation, there is a natural synergy, a confluence of various aspects of this gaming and fitness industry. And we will have a place in Singapore where we will have content and game developers coalesce, we will have hardware developers as well, and, of course, those who are involved in technology, including things like wearables, which are gaining prevalence in the way in which we do fitness. So, all of that will be in Singapore and we intend to work with them to develop this ecosystem and strengthen Singapore's position for sport-tech solutions. In relation to the para-sport academies, we intend to work with several sports first, as a start. In the first instance, we will probably use the existing framework and infrastructure and work with the Disabilities Sports Council to see how we can move the para-athletes into the system in this way. I think that is the fastest way to scale up. Over time, I appreciate that each sport may be different and the way in which we train, nurture and develop our para-athletes may be different sport to sport, and may also be different between a para-athlete and able-bodied athlete. But as we develop the base and infrastructure, we will begin to scale up with the expertise so that more of them can enter the system in this way. As to Mr Mark Chay's point about what are the potential pathways, we intend to put them on the same platform as the able-bodied athletes. If the able-bodied athletes have a certain pathway opportunity, we intend to make sure that we put the para-athletes on the same track, on the same path, so that there is equality, if not in terms of outcomes, certainly in terms of where the starting point should be.\"], ['Mr Darryl David', 'Chairman, I just have one clarification. It is very heartening to hear the plans shared by Minister of State Low Yen Ling and Minister Edwin Tong about how they intend to support, invigorate and promote the arts industry in Singapore. Minister Edwin Tong talked about having safe spaces for the arts, for expression and development. He talked about 45 Armenian Street. I would just like to ask the Minister if he could perhaps expound a bit more on whether there will be more of such spaces that will be provided for our arts community and also what are some of the resources and facilities that could perhaps be put in place in these spaces.'], ['Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai', \"Thank you, Mr Darryl David. When it comes to arts spaces, our objective is really, one, given Singapore's land scarcity, we want to ensure optimal usage and efficiency in usage; second, we want to ensure that there is fair access because we have new and younger groups coming through and we want to ensure that for the space there is sufficient turnover so that they can also occupy the spaces and there are opportunities for these new growing groups to incubate and experiment; and, finally, we want these spaces to continue to remain relevant. In some cases, we update the spaces so that old spaces can be used for new purposes. Over time, I think we have had the opportunity to grow the spaces available. If you take just the real estate purposes, over the last 10 years, we have grown it by about 35% in terms of absolute real estate space dedicated to arts users. And we continually look at how we can refresh the existing spaces. I will just give you some examples, some of which my colleagues have touched on earlier. We have the Tanjong Pagar Distripark (TPD). We all know that there used to be a place where container cranes and so on occupy those spaces. It is an unlikely space, but if you think about it, it is actually quite intuitive to use it as an arts space – high ceilings, large walls – you can have displays there that you cannot otherwise do in our current settings or spaces. So, we are using this as an experiment to develop this into a new hub for arts spaces. The Member spoke about 45 Armenian Street as well – 45 Armenian Street is a place with lots of history. Many of our arts practitioners know the place as a young experimental place with buzz where you come in, you incubate, you spend some time learning from each other as well. So, we wanted to develop this with the same kind of feeling and ethos. And it is in that respect that we invited practitioners, leaders of the arts community – Mae Anderson, Janice Koh, and I mentioned some names earlier – to come and share their experience with us and think in terms of how to envision this space for future use. Kampong Java is another space that we looked at. All of you probably drive past it each day and not realise that it is there. It used to be used terrace houses that are now disused. So, we worked with SLA to take advantage of the fact that it has not been used and see how we could repurpose it. It used to be terrace properties, so, a little bit grungy, a little bit rundown, but quite perfect and ideal for arts spaces. So, we reimagined the space, thought about how these can become independent affordable spaces for, again, experimental and incubatory arts companies. And we are working with the arts industry also to get ideas as to how this can be managed and operated. These are some examples of the thinking in terms of how we can expand on existing spaces, old spaces, to bring them into new ones. And also, ultimately, use the spaces fairly and efficiently and ensuring that, as and when we have new companies, new ideas, new forms of art coming through, they will also have their space in the sun and be able to develop.\"], ['Mr Sitoh Yih Pin', 'Thank you, Mr Chairman. I would like to thank Minister Edwin Tong, his entire MCCY team, as well as all the Members who have spoken. With that, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment. Thank you.']]\n",

      "[['Mr Hri Kumar Nair', 'Sir, I beg to move, That the total sum to be allocated for Head R of the Estimates be reduced by $100. Sir, this year’s Budget has a central theme of inclusiveness. Many Members in the House have spoken about what that means – helping the elderly, helping low-income families, Singaporeans with disabilities. One other group which should not be forgotten are those who require expert advice to navigate our laws and legal procedures so as to ensure that their rights are protected and advanced but do not have the means to pay for it. In criminal proceedings, life and liberty may be at stake. We have done much to simplify our laws to make them more friendly and less tied to the formal and rigid processes of the days gone by. We have gone to the extent of substituting technical and even Latin phrases with modern everyday language so that our laws are more intuitive and can be better understood. But the law and its workings remain a mystery to most. Most are intimidated by it and would prefer to avoid the legal process even if it can help them. Page: 2037 The concept of access to justice involves being able to access the court and judicial remedies, as well as legal representation. Legal representation is vital, particularly because of the adversarial nature of our legal system that is structured for and by the legally educated. While a person is entitled to represent himself in court, the truth of the matter is that most litigants in person will have a hard time knowing what to do and understanding what is going on. And so, hiring a lawyer becomes a necessity, but that is difficult for many as professional legal fees and even the routine disbursements you have to incur are not low. To help Singaporeans who cannot afford legal representation, we need to have a ready pool of lawyers who will act for free or at substantially reduced fees. That brings me to one Latin term, which remains with us because it has been woven into our language: pro bono publico or pro bono for short, which means \"for the public good\". Pro bono work should remain at the forefront of the legal profession, as we must never forget that the practice of law is a noble calling and is ultimately for the service of the public good. It should be the aim of every self-respecting legal system to ensure that access to justice is not obstructed by the individual’s pecuniary circumstances. Today, there are schemes to provide legal help to individuals who cannot afford it, such as the Legal Aid Bureau and the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. Many lawyers provide free legal clinics at community centres, religious institutions and other organisations every week. Some firms even offer pro bono services but, save for few exceptions, these are usually left to the individual lawyers to participate in and are not structured. For a lawyer, particularly a junior one who is under pressure to meet the demands of the court, the client, his senior partner and that \"master\" known as billable hours, pro bono work may be a luxury he can ill afford and cannot commit to on a regular basis. As a result, pro bono work is still considered an exception rather than the norm in our legal system. However, I strongly believe that there is a great untapped potential in the legal profession to offer such services. Many lawyers are willing to do pro bono work and give back to the community. What they need is a system or structure, within the profession and, particularly, within their own firms, to facilitate this and recognise their contributions. In the opening of the Legal Year, the honourable Chief Justice proposed that firms could encourage pro bono work by crediting such work with a notional income based on what they would have earned for the firm at their normal charge-out rates. This would help reduce the pressure on lawyers who turn away pro bono work and will focus the effort on the firm and not just as individuals. I believe that this is a sound step forward and should be encouraged. It has also been suggested that lawyers should be mandated to complete a minimum number of pro bono hours as part of the continuing professional development. I understand mandatory rules make it more convenient and efficient to implement a pro bono system, but I would prefer that such initiatives be voluntary and driven from the ground by the lawyers and the law firms because they see a need for this and the good it will do. Every single lawyer must be imbued with the mindset that each has a role to play – from junior lawyer to senior lawyer and from every field of practice. Making it compulsory detracts from the spirit in which this help should be offered. But the Government can help to make this a reality. It should work towards providing a framework that will allow lawyers to offer pro bono services and get recognition without being saddled with copious paperwork or heavy administrative costs. For example, pro bono work should only benefit those who need financial assistance. However, it would be onerous for lawyers and law firms to administer means-testing. If, for example, there is a registry which can certify individuals who qualify for pro bono assistance, lawyers can take on these cases with the knowledge that their goodwill is being extended to the right recipients. Page: 2038 The Government can also help in other ways. For example, cases which have been certified pro bono should enjoy discounted filing fees and shorter waiting times for lawyers so that the time they can devote to billable work will not be too compromised. Could the Government share its plans on promoting pro bono work and, in particular, how it can reduce the disincentives for lawyers to participate in such work? On a related note, many cases which would qualify for pro bono work will be in the domestic practices in criminal and family law. During the debate on the amendments to the LPA, I spoke of the danger of how such practices are in danger of hollowing out as more law graduates turn to more lucrative and sexier corporate and arbitration. We need to ensure that there are sufficient lawyers in the system to practise in these domestic areas. One source of lawyers would be graduates from non-recognised universities as well as those with external law degrees. Some of them have switched careers midway. They, too, have dreams of practising law and have made considerable efforts and incurred huge sums to obtain a law degree. We should not deny them the opportunity to practise simply because of the school they went to. If the concern is to ensure those who practise law are of sufficient calibre, we can address that by making the Practice Law Course rigorous enough to ensure that only those of the right quality will be called to the Bar. In other words, we set the standards for admission and not rely on someone else’s examinations. I hope the Government will consider this suggestion. I would also be grateful if the Government could share what steps it will take to ensure that there are sufficient numbers of practising lawyers in Singapore. Legal Aid Qualifying Criteria'], ['Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai', 'Sir, more than 50 years ago, in April 1956, when the Legal Aid and Advice Bill was first introduced, its aim was stated to be to make legal aid and advice in the colony more readily available to persons of limited means. That mission of a legal aid bureau remains valid today except that the absolute definition of \"limited means\" must be considered in the context of changing income levels. Applicants for legal aid have to undergo means testing before such aid is granted. The means criteria has got two components, both of which must be satisfied independently. An applicant’s disposable income which is income in the past 12 months before the date of application, after deducting prescribed allowances, must not exceed $10,000. In addition, as a separate head, the disposable capital after relevant allowances must also not exceed $10,000. Page: 2039 Sir, I hope the Minister can consider a review of the means criteria of both respects. First, the disposable capital criteria. This is meant to exclude persons who have significant capital assets, such as motor vehicle or private property. Anecdotally, there have been instances where applications have been rejected where the disposable capital exceeds $10,000 on account of the surrender value of life insurance policies. Sir, the surrender value of $10,000 is not very high and there is a growing number in our population who own life insurance policies. More importantly, a legal aid applicant, unlike for a motorcar or property, should not be expected to cash out on life insurance policies to fund his legal expenditure. Sir, I hope the Minister can consider raising the disposable capital when it comes to surrender value for life insurance policies. Second, disposable income criteria. Sir, the last time a review was done, it was in 2007. By way of illustration, the median household income for all residents and the average monthly household income from work of residents have risen about 35%-40% in that period. Whilst figures do not tell us everything, what it does tell us is that the means criteria should be regularly and constantly revised to keep pace with the changing income levels. Sir, in that regard, would the Minister also consider reviewing the relevant disposable income levels as a means criteria testing? Criminal Procedure'], ['Ms Sylvia Lim', 'Sir, the Court of Appeal judgement in Muhammad bin Kadar v PP (2011) 3SRL 1205 was a welcome breakthrough in our journey towards a more balanced criminal process. The judges squarely addressed an issue I had first canvassed five years ago at MINLAW COS which fell on deaf ears then. Due to the vast State powers in investigations and gathering evidence, the prosecution should rightly be under a duty to disclose to the defence before trial relevant evidence gathered even if the prosecution does not intend to use it, especially if it is helpful to the defence. After the judgement, the prosecution got worried and took out an application to clarify its scope, in particular, whether the prosecution was under a duty to go through all the evidence gathered by investigators in order to disclose it. The Court of Appeal clarified that it was not under such a duty and needed only to disclose evidence which the prosecution was itself aware of. This, unfortunately, may give rise to some potential for miscarriages of justice if the processes between the police and the prosecution are not tightened up. There should not a situation where the police shield prosecutors from relevant evidence gathered resulting in prosecutors not being aware of it and accordingly being under no duty to disclose it. That should defeat the purpose of the judgement. The Kadar case noted that, in the UK, there is a disclosure manual guiding police on what they should disclose to the prosecution. This document is publicly available for scrutiny at the website of the Crown Prosecution Service. The British police designate disclosure officers to go through the evidence and prepare schedules of unused evidence to be disclosed to the prosecutor. On 9 January 2012, the Minister for Law updated the House that prosecutors had been briefing investigators on the requirements laid down in Kadar. Can the Ministry tell us what the duties of disclosure are between the police and the prosecution? Will there be a detailed document published for public scrutiny? 2.15 pm Page: 2040 Recognition of External Law Degrees'], ['Mr Chen Show Mao', 'Sir, currently, external law degrees are not recognised for admission to the Singapore Bar. This was based on recommendations in 1993 by the First Committee on the Supply of Lawyers, as part of broader measures to restrict the supply of lawyers and enhance the quality of the legal service in Singapore. In coming to the recommendation, the Committee took into consideration the comparative entry requirement, time taken to complete the degree, class supervision and interaction time as well as access to resources of external and full-time degrees. Nevertheless, the Committee recognised that there could be outstanding external degree students who could make a valuable contribution to Singapore’s legal services sector, thus individuals can seek an exemption from the Minister for Law to be granted in his discretion. External law degrees are so called, as they involve study outside where the university offering the course is based. External law studies may be on a part-time or full-time basis. Part-time study is particularly suited to students who wish to study for a law degree but need to continue working in their full-time jobs, say, as police officers, accountants, legal secretaries or paralegals in law firms. One emphasis of this year’s Budget is on increasing productivity. We are investing significantly in continuing education and training to help our workers develop new skills and expertise and increase their versatility. In view of the above, it may be timely to ask whether the existing rules may be changed or discretion exercised in such a way to allow more external law degree holders to take the Bar examination and undergo relevant legal training at law firms for admission to the Bar, like many of their counterparts holding full-time law degrees. Many external law degree holders are mature students who may have first degrees in other disciplines or work experience in other fields; who for various reasons, often financial, have taken to the study of law only late in life. The value of such cross-training, such work experience and industry knowledge, such versatility, is increasingly recognised and may be helpful and desirable to future clients, provided that the external law degree holder is admitted to practise. Much has changed since the First Committee made its recommendations almost 20 years ago. In fact, the Third Committee on the Supply of Lawyers has since recommended measures that will, in effect, increase the number of practising lawyers in Singapore to ensure Singapore’s growth as a leading provider of legal services. In these 20 years, factors such as technological changes affecting distance learning may also have addressed in part some of the concerns expressed by the First Committee, such as those over class supervision and interaction time, and access to resources for external law students. In any case, for an external degree holder who is granted exemption by the Minister, she would only be admitted to practise after she has passed the Bar examination and undergone relevant legal training at a law firm, which ought to afford us reasonable assurance as to her ability to practise law. I believe it is timely for us to consider or reconsider if more, like her, should be given that chance. Page: 2041 Prosecutorial Discretion'], ['Mr Pritam Singh', 'Thank you, Mr Chairman. This is the cut on Prosecutorial Discretion. I refer to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ramalingam Ravinthran vs Attorney-General with specific reference to the nature and width of prosecutorial discretion as vested in the Attorney-General (AG) by Article 35(8) of the Constitution. Ramalingam Ravinthran was charged with a capital drug offence, while his co-accused was charged with a non-capital drug offence. Both men committed the same offence, but the charge preferred against Ramalingam was not reduced to a non-capital one. In the aftermath of the court’s ruling, it was noteworthy that there were two relatively clear public camps on the matter, one contending that the Attorney-General, as Public Prosecutor, should explain how discretion was exercised in such cases. The other camp opined that the public should trust the Attorney-General and that he will carry out his duties in good faith. In the Ramalingam case, the Court of Appeal accepted that the Attorney-General has no general obligation to disclose his reasons for a particular prosecutorial decision. I also note the Attorney-General’s Chambers issued a press release on 20 January 2011 on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, assuring the public that the decision to charge an individual is made very carefully. Nonetheless, in view of the gravity of the punishment prescribed for drug offences that carry the mandatory death penalty, would it not be better for the Attorney-General to explain the reasons for his discretion to charge some accused offenders with a capital charge, and yet others for a non-capital offence for the same transaction? In addition, taking public interest into account, would not disclosure by the Attorney-General also engender greater trust in the legal system, and in the office of the Attorney-General? Simplification of Legal Processes'], ['Mr Desmond Lee', 'Sir, during the Debate on the President’s Address last year, I asked the Ministry of Law to further enhance access to justice for the man-in-the-street by simplifying legal processes at the common interface between community and the law. This will make it easier for laypersons to navigate the law, particularly if they fall outside the Legal Aid Bureau’s means test, but who still find it expensive to engage a lawyer. This can be an area for the Law Reform Committee to regularly look into. Some areas of practice ripe for review include family law and inheritance law, for example. Let us just take a look at the process for the application for probate and letters of administration, and you will know exactly what I mean. To apply, one needs to prepare a number of documents, including (a) a petition by way of originating summons; (b) a checklist; (c) a supporting affidavit; (d) two copies of the Schedule of Assets; (e) an Administration Oath; (f) certified true copies of the death certificate and Will; (g) if the Will is not in English, then certified true translations; and (h) a certificate of result of caveat search together with the search reports from both the High Court and Subordinate Courts. These documents must be electronically filed at the Service Bureau, which attracts fees. There are also procedures to be followed for electronic filing. After Probate or Letter of Administration is granted, it needs to be extracted through a Request to Extract Grant of Probate or Letter of Administration and the filing of the Administration Bond by sureties. The person extracting the grant must also check to ensure there are no caveats in force against the estate. Page: 2042 Sir, the purpose of Probate and Administration is to ensure propriety in the handling of a person’s estate. Estate duty is no longer payable. While the process is relatively easy for lawyers, it is not the case for the man-in-the-street, who will at some point in time need to engage in this process. I also hope Ministry of Law will consider amending the law to allow the Public Trustee to help administer small estates below $50,000 which are non-contentious but which involve the Will. These are usually simple estates. I urge the Ministry of Law to look at these and other procedures for review. Internet Regulation'], ['Mr Pritam Singh', 'Mr Chairman, this is the cut on Internet Regulation. I refer to the Minister’s comments made in early January at the launch of \"The Mortal Enemy\", the winning trailer for The Originals Get Reel Contest organised by the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), where it was revealed that the Government is in discussion with the Motion Pictures Association of America (MPAA) over the issue of piracy and intellectual property protection. It is noteworthy that the Government’s concerns were similar to the concerns raised by some United States lawmakers, who have sought to pursue the now apparently derailed legislative proposals in the United States for legislation known as the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA). Mr Chairman, one of the main purposes of these Bills was to make it harder for sites €” especially those located outside the United States €” to sell or distribute pirated copyrighted material, such as movies and music, as well as physical goods, such as counterfeit purses and watches. On the one hand, the importance of protecting intellectual property is self-evident. However, the worry is that such a move will introduce many unwanted consequences, such as the stifling of legitimate expression of free speech. One of the biggest fears is that such legislation can be abused and could lead to censorship, on the pretext of protecting intellectual property and preventing online piracy. Since the launch of the Mortal Enemy and Minister’s remarks on the same, SOPA and PIPA are apparently dead in the water in the US, as the co-sponsors of the legislation have withdrawn the Bill, ostensibly to seek more agreement on the matter. On its part, the Obama administration has said that it would not support any legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cyber-security risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet even as it recognises the serious problems posed by online piracy. Can the Minister please clarify what stage of talks the Government is at with the Motion Pictures Association of America (MPAA), and what plans it currently has for similar legislation in Singapore? Protecting Intellectual Property Rights of SMEs'], ['Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai', 'Sir, this year’s Budget encourages SMEs to find new ways to increase performance and productivity. Innovation is about all the development of new ideas to reap better economic performance. New inventions and innovative ideas can be harnessed and put to use in improving the operations of a business or it can also be exploited by the innovator by selling the idea or invention, or by licensing it to or managing it for third parties. Page: 2043 Sir, in that context, it is vital that the IP regime and environment of Singapore be robust and accessible. There are two aspects to this. The first is the enhancement of Singapore as a regional or even a global hub for IP services, much in the same way that the Government has successfully developed Singapore as a leading arbitration hub. We should build our infrastructure and offer tax and other incentives for global MNCs to come to Singapore to develop, manufacture and exploit their patents here. In the last 10 years, Singapore’s IP landscape has seen much progress. But the need continues to grow. Between 2006 and 2011, the number of patent applications by local enterprises in Singapore almost doubled. And these numbers reflect the global trend. In China, for example, patent filings have increased significantly in the last decade and the Chinese government has been aggressively building its IP marketplace, with IP exchanges being set up providing a suite of services, such as matching, valuation services and, generally, facilitating IP transactions. These allow IP owners to monetise their IP assets. Singapore, with its complementary legal and financial services infrastructure, can also prosper in this space. Will the Minister share his plans for enhancing Singapore as an IT hub and how the services which make up the entire IP ecosystem in Singapore can be enhanced? Of particular importance will be how local SMEs can stand to benefit from such enhancements. It appears that some SMEs do not fully exploit their IP rights due to lack of awareness or perhaps because their existing environment is not sufficiently conducive. Will the Minister be able to address this as well? The second aspect is to build a strong culture and system for the protection and enforcement of IP rights and resolving conflicts in an efficacious manner. This is crucial to fostering intervention and innovation. Without appropriate protection being given to businesses, it is unlikely that businesses, both local and global, will be incentivised to innovate and operate within the fields in Singapore. May I, therefore, ask the Minister what plans he has in ensuring a stronger, more robust IP regime for the recognition and protection of IP rights. Intellectual Property Dispute Resolution'], ['Mr Vikram Nair', 'Thank you, Sir. The protection of IP rights is important to many industries, including media, technology, entertainment and pharmaceuticals. Asia is an increasingly important hub for many of these and Singapore, in particular, is getting stronger in biotechnology. One important aspect of growing an IP hub is the protection of IP rights. Before continuing on this particular aspect, I should probably declare my interest as a lawyer practising at Norton Rose (Asia). In the past, many of the high profile IP litigations took place in the western markets. Examples would include litigations involving HTC, Samsung, LG, Sony and so on. Domestically, in recent years, we have seen a number of IP-related disputes across a variety of sectors, including media, technology and pharmaceuticals. Might we expect more of such cases in Singapore? IP disputes, in particular, are known to be highly complex, requiring an intricate understanding of law, technology and business practices. As markets develop and sophisticated IP licensing deals become more common, we might find increasingly complicated IP disputes being brought before the courts. How can we ensure that Singapore’s capacity to deliver efficient and effective dispute resolution for such cases is available? And this is particularly because of the different skills involved; it is not necessarily purely legal skills. Page: 2044 Singapore has also made significant progress in establishing ourselves as the key arbitration and mediation hub in Asia. And I was wondering whether Singapore would also be playing a greater role in catering for IP alternative dispute resolution, along with our growth as an IP hub. 2.30 pm Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office’s Caseload and Service Levels'], ['Ms Sylvia Lim', \"Several of my constituents are undischarged bankrupts. They wish to move their cases along but tell me of the frustration they face in dealing with the Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office (IPTO). I am not sure if this is representative of overall service levels but this has been their experience. Their feedback is that trying to fix appointments with the IPTO officers in charge of their cases is difficult and results in long delays. When they want to leave phone messages, the mailboxes are full. There was one incident when a proposal for settlement made took more than a year to elicit a response. From the statistics published on IPTO’s caseload, it appears that, overall, the number of new bankruptcy cases and new corporate insolvencies each year had fallen over a 10-year period. This does not tell us of the caseload accumulated over the years or whether there are particular bottlenecks which have affected service delivery. Specifically, since the Bankruptcy Act was amended in 2009, bankruptcy applications where the debt is $100,000 or less have to be referred by the High Court to the Official Assignee for assessment as to whether they should be placed under a Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS) in lieu of bankruptcy. What has been the impact of the DRS on IPTO’s workflow? Would it make sense, for example, to outsource DRS' assessments to an accounting firm? In summary, how does IPTO measure its service delivery levels? Bankruptcy Regime in Singapore\"], ['Mr Vikram Nair', 'Sir, I have many residents who are undischarged bankrupts, just like Ms Sylvia Lim mentioned as well, and I understand that more help is now being provided by IPTO to help bankrupts work towards repaying their debts and being discharged from bankruptcy, including two financial rehabilitation programmes announced last October. However, I wonder if our bankruptcy regime can be more compassionate towards discharging bankrupts who are unable to service their payments as a result of, say, ill health, old age or other inability to generate income. I have personally encountered many such cases at Meet-the-People sessions. In one case, a retiree, who was withdrawing his CPF, had to repay the Official Assignee because he was having difficulty juggling his medical expenses. Page: 2045 I just wonder if there is enough flexibility in the bankruptcy regime to accommodate such difficult or hardship cases. Regulation of Moneylenders'], ['Mr Chen Show Mao', 'Sir, when the Moneylenders Act was re-enacted in 2008, its stated objectives were to facilitate moneylending in the modern credit economy and to strike a proper balance between regulating licensed moneylenders and safeguarding the interest of borrowers. In liberalising the market, many of the controls under the old Act were relaxed. Importantly, interest rate caps were removed except for 18% for unsecured and 12% for secured loans of up to $3,000 granted to low-income borrowers. Just three years after the Act took effect, the results of that liberalisation appeared to be trending clear. The number of licensed moneylenders increased from 173 in 2008 to 249 in 2011. The press reported that interest rates are as high as 240% a year and effective rates could be even higher. And even though some interest rate ceilings are in place, the press reported that debtors are often subjected to additional high charges under permitted fees. These include fees for loan administration and late payment charges. According to press reports, the Registry of Moneylenders received 67 complaints in 2010, up from 16 the year before. Most complaints were about high interest rates, strong-arm debt collection methods and unfair loan terms and conditions. The Government has recognised that more action needs to be taken. It has implemented new rules to regulate the advertising and other activities of licensed moneylenders. It has imposed a fit and proper test and written test. There is now a Bill before Parliament to increase some enforcement powers. In addition to these measures, would the Government consider additional substantive regulations of the interest rates and fees charged by the moneylenders? Sir, the high interest rates and fees and the number of complaints reported seem to suggest that this segment of the credit market, for whatever reason, is not functioning well to deliver benefits to its participants, which include not only the licensed moneylenders but also the borrowers who turn to them. Licensed Moneylenders'], ['Mr Arthur Fong', 'Mr Chairman, Sir, the moneylending business in Singapore affects a vulnerable segment of our society. More so, the family members of the borrowers are affected and bear the brunt of the methods of these lenders, licensed or otherwise. We need to keep in view and regularly update the enforcement methods and even more stringent legislation to ensure that the interests of this segment of Singaporeans are adequately protected. The moneylending industry, Sir, is a lucrative one. It has grown from 2007 to 2011 by 60%, from 169 to 267. The attraction of this business has prompted these operators to set up branches in neighbouring countries. Licensed or not, their business model evolves and changes and we must keep up with their practices. Sir, we need to ensure that the applicants and those approved are closely monitored and not allow them to use the Moneylenders Act as a Trojan horse. Some ground response has fed back that the licensed moneylenders’ methods in collection management are no different from the \"Ah Longs\"or illegal moneylenders, known as loansharks. We need, therefore, to have better control, audit the methods and ensure compliance with the Act, much like the financial institutions registered with MAS are subjected to. Licensed moneylenders, on top of their interest rates, will have other fees and charges snowballing to as high as 260%, even higher than what Mr Chairman was talking about – 260% of the borrowed sum. This is no different from the unlicensed loansharks, as reported in the media. Moneylenders are creative in charging all sorts of miscellaneous fees and administration costs to the borrower. Page: 2046 Sir, I hope the Ministry may be able to better control and supervise on-the-ground practices and to draw up a transparent schedule of charges so that there is transparency available to the borrowers. Community Mediation'], ['Mr Desmond Lee', 'Sir, an inclusive society is one where there is tolerance, respect and mutual understanding. Yet, when people live cheek-by-jowl in highly urban Singapore, disputes among neighbours are almost inevitable. The number of mediations conducted by the Community Mediation Centres (CMCs) has generally been rising over the years. It is very telling that 75% of all disputes mediated by CMCs involve neighbourly disputes. The next highest, 12%, are between family members. More than 60% of disputes involve people below the age of 50. Some of these disputes have hit the headlines. But many other squabbles that take place all over the island are no less serious. In the last month alone, I had been asked to intervene in three neighbour disputes, all of which already involved the police. One pair of neighbours came last night and sought my assistance. All these cases involved young or middle-aged families. While as a matter of principle, mediation should be a voluntary process conducted in the spirit of conciliation and give-and-take, I feel that there are some instances where disputes may have become so serious that a far more robust approach may be warranted. This could involve making attendance at mediation sessions mandatory if assessed to be sufficiently serious and are referred by certain agencies, such as the Police or the CDCs. This is far better than letting the matter escalate to the Courts, or worse, letting the feuding parties take things into their own hands. There may also be some value in giving the Community Mediation Centres legal teeth to require neighbours to keep the peace. For example, the Community Mediation Centres Act can contain powers similar to those found in the CPC to require warring parties who have reached a settlement at the CMC to sign a bond to keep the peace. I hope MinLaw will study these ideas for the future.'], ['The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)', 'Sir, I thank all the Members who have spoken. I will first deal with the points made by Messrs Edwin Tong, Vikram Nair and Pritam Singh on IP. Sir, IP has become an important part of the global economy. The value of intangible assets for S&P 500 companies, of which IP is a major component, is about 80%. Thirty years ago, it was just 17%. Over the last decade, global patent and trademark filings have increased by over 40%. Worldwide royalty and licensing revenue has more than doubled, to over US$200 billion. These trends will continue. Singapore must try and ride on this trend. Our strengths are a well-developed legal and financial system, and a workforce that is comfortable with science and technology. At the same time, our challenge is that we have a small domestic market which faces difficulties in creating the marketplace and generating the demand for IP services. Our ambition is to make Singapore the Asian IP Hub. We have progressed well so far. Since 2006, Singapore’s IP regime has been consistently ranked amongst the best in the world by the World Economic Forum as well as the IMD. Page: 2047 We need to progress further. We will convene an IP Steering Committee to study and develop the IP Hub Masterplan. Members of the Committee will be from both the private and public sectors. The Committee will be chaired by Mr Teo Ming Kian, who was formerly Chairman EDB, Chairman of the then National Science and Technology Board and Permanent Secretary (National Research and Development). He is eminently qualified to lead the committee. The committee will look into two key areas: (1) developing a vibrant marketplace for IP transactions and commercialisation; and (2) building world-class IP capabilities and infrastructure. The first thrust is to develop a vibrant IP marketplace. The technology market is changing rapidly and considerably. Consumer products combine IP in diverse and complex ways. Some sources cite that a typical smartphone today involves as many as 250,000 patent claims. Significant IP transactions are required to achieve such aggregation. The Committee will recommend strategies to: develop Singapore as the marketplace of choice to transact IP; attract international firms and professionals who provide IP transactional services, for example, licensing and brokerage; and incentivise the creation, management and exploitation of IP in Singapore. This will also benefit local companies which, as Mr Edwin Tong points out, are creating more IP. The second thrust is to build world-class IP capabilities and infrastructure. There are many different aspects to it, including IP filing and protection. We will enhance our patent regime. At present, we adopt a self-assessment system, where patents can be granted even if objections are raised in the examination report. To enhance it, we should move to a positive grant system where patents will be granted only if patentability requirements are fully met first. This will increase confidence in the quality of Singapore patents. We will also develop indigenous search and examination capabilities for patent applications in niche technology areas. Currently, search and examination work is outsourced. We aim to develop world-class expertise to attract companies in the region to have patents in niche areas examined in Singapore. We also aim to develop the patent agent sector. There are about 100 Singapore-registered patent agents in practice today. We want Singapore to be a key node in global patent work. We aim to attract world-class patent firms to operate here. We want to enable Singapore to service more of the regional demand, and benefit local companies and research institutions as well. We will provide better support to develop the local patent agent profession. Page: 2048 Enforcing IP rights: Mr Singh asked about our review of measures to address online piracy. He has some concerns about whether this is all a pretext and whether we are going to curtail freedom of speech under the pretext of protecting IP. I think there are any number of hypotheses one can come up with on a review that is not yet concluded. Let me give Mr Singh and Members some data on what is actually happening now. Our position has generally been that IP, including copyright, is a private right. Its enforcement should be initiated by owners of those rights. Under our current regime, copyright owners have the ability to take actions against online copyright infringements. In recent years, owners of copyright have indicated that digital piracy was increasingly taking place online and that the traditional approach to address piracy would no longer be sufficient for a number of reasons. Time does not permit me to go into that. We formed an inter-agency working group last year to look into the various issues concerning copyright, including that of online piracy. The Working Group has been consulting various parties to determine the impact of piracy in Singapore and has also been assessing the measures employed in other countries. 2.45 pm What is the current status of online piracy in Singapore? Based on the data that rights holders have shared with us, Singapore appears to have one of the highest incidences of online piracy in the Asia-Pacific region. According to various studies and inputs from rights holders, it has been estimated that Singapore had over 300,000 incidences per month of illegal downloading on average. It ranked the worst out of 15 countries in the Asia-Pacific with 0.8 per capita incidences of infringement per annum. In 2010, over 693,000 connections were detected in unauthorised sharing of video games and work software on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks through internet service providers (ISPs) located in Singapore. Six out of the top hundred sites visited by Singapore internet users for November 2011 host some copyright infringing content. Over 20% of internet users in Singapore accessed selected file-sharing websites at least once a month; and 3.7 million P2P downloads of US major movies were initiated by Singapore users. There are some caveats. The data focuses on online piracy and does not include figures for piracy of hardcopy CDs and DVDs, which would be higher in other Asia-Pacific countries. There is evidence that the consumption of online printed material is not insignificant here. There is also feedback from one of the ISPs that there is a higher number of copyright infringement notices for its Singaporean subscribers compared to those in Hong Kong and Australia. We have been warned of possible consequences. Rights holders have stated that digital music sales make up a large percentage of music producers’ revenue. Online piracy, if unchecked, could reduce the revenue. The Recording Industry Association of Singapore (RIAS) has reported that physical sales have declined from US$42.4 million to US$14.5 million in the decade leading up to 2010, and were expected to fall further. However, unlike the rest of Asia and the world, the decline in physical sales in Singapore has not been compensated by a rise in digital sales. RIAS has warned that this, in turn, could reduce the funding available for the development of new musical talent in Singapore and stifle the growth of the creative industry. Page: 2049 There have also been some concerns raised that online piracy has contributed to providers of legitimate online content staying away from Singapore. There could be other problems, but these have been suggested to us. EDB has estimated that the music industry could be worth about US$34.1 billion in direct benefits; US$133.5 billion in indirect benefits in the longer term. So, I would invite Mr Singh eventually, when I finish, to make it clear whether he is indeed suggesting that this review is being based on a pretext or some other motive. Let us have the review. We are aware of concerns both by the industry and our need to be an IP Hub with tremendous value for our creative producers, our young talents. At the same time, we are also aware of the concerns on the other side where people are very concerned about how any rules or regulations could impact on a whole variety of areas. We are very mindful, and that is why we are conducting a review. And eventually when the review committee comes to a conclusion, we will have that in Parliament. At that time, one can see whether this is all a pretext or not. Mr Nair spoke on our IP dispute resolution capabilities and how they can grow. We agree that our IP dispute resolution capabilities must grow in tandem with the growth of IP transactions. Since last year, specially IP-trained Registrars at the Supreme Court conduct pre-trial conferences and hearings. While any High Court Judge may be able to handle IP cases, the Court has recently announced the formal designation of judges with considerable experience and expertise in IP cases as IP Judges. IPOS has collaborated with the World Intellectual Property Organisation Arbitration and Mediation Centre in Singapore. Under the MOU, disputes about the ownership and validity of IP rights filed with IPOS can be resolved through mediation at the Centre. We are looking into setting up a panel of expert IP adjudicators drawn from professionals to hear IP registration disputes Taken together, the initiatives will help grow our capabilities and expertise in IP dispute resolution. Next, let me turn to the issue of the supply of lawyers. I think Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Chen Show Mao made some comments on this. It is important that we get this right to ensure access to justice and in respect of our efforts to be a legal hub. It involves both qualitative and quantitative aspects, and it is something that we are continuously monitoring. Our current approach is that we recognise degrees from the two Singapore law schools, and scheduled universities in the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand − they number 35. Many choose such avenues, and exemptions are also granted to those who have studied in non-scheduled universities on a case-by-case basis. The current policy on external degrees has two aspects: (1) the degree itself; and (2) the individual. Page: 2050 On the degree itself, as Mr Chen remarked, this was first considered by the First Committee on the Supply of Lawyers in 1993, headed by then Attorney-General (now Chief Justice) with a Supreme Court Judge, Permanent Secretary (Law), Permanent Secretary (Trade & Industry), as well as the Deputy Vice Chancellor of NUS (now Justice Tan Lee Meng), and the Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law. They considered very carefully the comparative entry requirements for such degree courses, the time taken to complete the degree, the amount of class supervision and class interaction time and access to resources. They concluded that they could not say, as a class, that external law degrees were equal to full-time degrees, and that, therefore, as a general policy, external law degrees have not been recognised. If we move to the individual, nevertheless we recognise that individuals who hold an external law degree can apply themselves diligently and prove themselves in any field, and the policy takes that into account; individuals who have substantial experience in the legal or law-related fields, who have been validated by the market as it were, are granted exemptions. Less than 30 have applied since 1994 and 11 of them have been granted exemptions. We have also made changes to allow more people to qualify. At the Third Committee on the Supply of Lawyers’ recommendation, we set up a second law school. The total number of graduates increased from 250 to 370, which is quite significant. The majority of that pioneer batch will be called to the Bar this year. Since 2009, we have replaced the one-year Diploma in Singapore Law course with an optional course followed by the Part A Bar Examination, and relaxed criteria to allow Second-Lower degree graduates from overseas universities to qualify. About 600 Singaporean/Permanent Resident law graduates from overseas universities have passed the Part A conversion examinations. In 2011, 210 law graduates sat for Part A and 92% passed. We have also replaced the post-graduate law course with the revamped Part B examination that everyone sits for. Nevertheless, our view is, and I agree with Mr Chen here, that the types of lawyers qualifying to practise should be reviewed again, to deal with changing conditions. For example, three factors (and he mentioned at least one of them): (1) the aspirants have difficulties getting into our law schools; (2) there is the cost of going overseas (we recognise that); and (3) smaller law firms have difficulties in finding lawyers; and I have mentioned that and one or two of the other factors a number of times. We do need to look into these areas and see what can be done. So, I have recently convened a Fourth Committee on the Supply of Lawyers to look into this and other issues, because I think we need to re-look − not just external law degrees but also the needs of the smaller law firms − how we can get people who have the aspirations to become lawyers but cannot afford to go overseas; what can we do about all of these, and how can we do it in a rational manner so that we have lawyers who are then able to use their skills in our marketplace. I think that is important as well. So, in that context, I have asked Judge of Appeal V K Rajah to head the Committee to look into these issues. The Committee will consider how to augment the talent pool for lawyers, including in domestic areas of law, for example, criminal and family law, which we consider to be important for access to justice. And they have been asked to consider possible adjustments to current admissions policy, including the external law degrees policy. Page: 2051 And they could consider − I think Mr Kumar mentioned it, if I am not wrong − moving to a model where a single Bar examination serves as the sole gatekeeper. It is one of many possible models. There are other approaches that can be considered. I do not want to pre-judge the Committee. Let them do their work and come back, and we will report it in Parliament. Let me now move to the administration of criminal justice. On prosecutorial discretion, Mr Singh’s point, we accept Article 35(8) of the Constitution vests prosecutorial discretion in the Attorney-General. The Court of Appeal, in the Ramalingam case, has held that the prosecutorial power is constitutionally co-equal to the judicial power, and the Court should be slow to interfere with its exercise. And I think it is important to see what the Court said in this context. In the Court’s judgement, at paragraphs 70 and 71, it says, \"In this regard, the mere differentiation of charges between co-offenders, even between those of equal guilt, is not per se sufficient to constitute prima facie evidence of bias or the taking into account of irrelevant considerations that breaches Article 12(1). Differentiation between offenders of equal guilt can be legitimately undertaken for many reasons and based on the consideration of many factors.\" Paragraph 71: \"... given that there are many legitimate reasons for the prosecution to differentiate between the charges brought against different offenders involved in the same criminal enterprise, such differentiation per se does not necessarily mean that the prosecution has not given unbiased consideration.\" And the Court, I am sure Mr Singh is aware, went on to say that there are many good reasons why differentiation may be necessary. It indicated some of those good reasons, including the fact that there could have been intelligence which the prosecution is not willing to share in the open. 3.00 pm Now, should we change the system? I think we need to start with a context here − what is the kind of criminal justice system that we want? We want a system where the guilty are convicted, the innocent are acquitted and the wider interests of society are protected, which include the protection of society from those who could cause it harm. If it is clear that public disclosure by the Attorney-General, of his reasons why differential treatment has been given, will improve the criminal justice system, then it is a no-brainer; we must make sure that the law requires such disclosures. So, the question is: is that clear? The reality is that the position is not so clear. There are trade-offs, as Members will know. What are the trade-offs here? If the reasons for the underlying prosecutorial decisions are revealed, it can compromise intelligence and other confidential sources that inform such decisions, which, as I said earlier, the Court of Appeal recognised. Let us not kid ourselves, you will have some criminals who will try and work around the guidelines and game the system. That is in the nature, not everyone, but there will be some people who will do that. Page: 2052 In the United Kingdom, as I am sure Mr Singh is aware, there was a case where a person applied to court, for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to disclose in advance, the guidelines that would inform the DPP’s decision whether an offence which was going to be committed would be prosecuted. So, I am going to do this, you tell me in advance − because you have published the guidelines − whether I will be prosecuted when I do this. On the other hand, if reasons are revealed, it can, of course, be a safeguard against the discretion being exercised wrongly or maliciously by the Attorney-General. So, the question that we have to ask ourselves is this: there are these two situations, the risk of the prosecution acting wrongly, compared to the risks associated with the compromise of intelligence and all the other attendant risks if disclosure is made. Which is the more serious risk in the context? Our view is that the prosecution acting wrongly or maliciously is the lesser of the two risks. The Attorney-General’s Chambers has internal guidelines and layers of review, and, in capital cases, the Attorney-General reviews the facts himself. The Court of Appeal has also held in Ramalingam that if a prosecutorial decision is untenable on its face, it must be explained, or else the Court will infer that there is no good reason for it. So, you have all these layers of checks and, within this framework, we believe that a system where the Attorney-General exercises his discretion without having to make those reasons public is better for society. If we are convinced of the opposite, I say to Members, unhesitatingly, that we will change the law. Let me now turn to discovery. Ms Sylvia Lim asked how the prosecution can work with the Police to ensure comprehensive discovery of relevant evidence, in the light of the Court of Appeal’s judgement in the Kadar case. I think we accept – Ms Lim accepts – and everyone who has read the judgement would accept, that the Kadar case did not go into how the Police and the prosecution should interact. That was stated clearly in the supplementary judgment. In practical terms, for the Police, the function and duty of both the investigators and investigation supervisors are that they need to go through the investigation papers and ensure that all relevant information is presented to the prosecutor. And the prosecution is under a duty to disclose relevant, credible, unused material in its possession to the accused, and that duty has been given statutory form through the CPC 2010, which we took through this House. And the prosecution has to work closely with the investigating officers to assess evidence in this regard. Any doubts in a case will be referred by the prosecutor or the investigating officer to their respective superiors, who will give guidance on the proper practice. Since the enactment of CPC 2010, AGC has been working on a joint Code of Practice for prosecutors and defence counsel, which will carry general guidance on disclosure. Following Kadar, the Attorney-General’s Chambers has also engaged the Law Society as well as the Association of Criminal Lawyers of Singapore (ACLS) to flesh out the disclosure obligations of the prosecution under Kadar, discussing and working out what the Bar will consider acceptable and appropriate. Both the AGC and the defence bar are attuned to the same objectives in the administration of a proper justice system. Page: 2053 Ms Lim said that, five years ago, she made some suggestions which fell on deaf ears. I am not sure I was in the House five years ago listening to her, being a backbencher then. I think what needs to be recognised in context is that the CPC and Penal Code have been amended substantively since then. Discovery by the prosecution and the defence, which are major steps, was included in the CPC which we took through the House, and the Penal Code which was taken through by my predecessor. Before we amended the CPC to substantively enhance the rights of the accused, we consulted extensively, including with Ms Lim, who made various suggestions. It was a long period of consultation. If we have seen how the law evolved, when we made the amendments and thereafter, I have more than once made clear in this House about the duties of the prosecution in respect of the evidence that they have, which is that the fundamental duty of any lawyer, whether prosecutor or defence, is to be honest with the Court. Honesty requires you to disclose all relevant evidence, whether or not it is in the Statute, and if you withhold credible evidence, that is misconduct. I took pains to make that clear, and the Court of Appeal referred to that statement I made here in Parliament in making its decision; it adopted that statement as the statement of principle in its decision in Kadar. So, when Ms Lim talks about a breakthrough in Kadar, the Court of Appeal was applying the law that we discussed in this House. Now, I have answered that question as best as I can from the Ministry of Law’s perspective. As for the detailed duties of the Police and what they may or may not do, it is something that I am in no position to answer because that is a Ministry of Home Affairs policy issue. But I can assure Ms Lim that in our consultations with MHA on various issues, including this, we have been assured, and I have set out for Ms Lim and Members, of the kind of processes that are now in place. Let me now turn to access to justice. Mr Desmond Lee spoke on access to justice generally, and probate in particular. We thank him. In respect of the Supreme Court, there are generally lower numbers of litigants-in-person. We created educational material providing information on court process for bankruptcy proceedings where most of the litigants-in-person in the Supreme Court are concentrated. Materials are available online and we are in the process of upgrading that. In the Subordinate Courts where you find more litigants-in-person, we have created a dedicated HELP (Helping to Empower Litigants-in-Person) Centre to help litigants navigate the court processes. We are collaborating with the Law Society and law firms to deploy pro bono lawyers at the HELP Centre. For example, the Singapore Association of Women Lawyers assists with pro bono clinics at the Family and Juvenile Division under the auspices of the HELP Centre. And we are in the process of putting together a \"Probate Toolkit\" to help litigants with the probate process as well. The toolkit will come with standard forms for simple probate cases. Mr Lee also raised a specific concern on simplifying the process for probate and letters of administration. We intend to review and update the Probate and Administration Act, together with the Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office. We will look at how we can refine the criteria and threshold of estate cases that can be administered by the Public Trustee, and how we can simplify the existing procedure. The Courts are supportive of all of these and we are working with them closely. Page: 2054 My Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ms Sim Ann, will further elaborate on two other pillars of our access to justice efforts – pro bono and legal aid – and also take the remaining cuts.'], ['The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Sim Ann)', 'Mr Chairman, Sir, Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Edwin Tong spoke on legal aid and pro bono. On legal aid, we will be revising the means test for legal aid. The last revision, as pointed out, was in 2007, and a review has started and will be completed soon. We will consider Mr Tong’s suggestion – which was also made by Mr Michael Palmer before he was elected as Speaker, as well as other Members – to exclude life insurance policies from the means test, and also revise the income criteria. The amendments will be tabled in the middle of the year. Next, please allow me to share some measures that we have been exploring with regard to fostering more pro bono work. Some measures which we have considered include, first, making pro bono work a mandatory component of legal education. The Singapore Institute of Legal Education (SILE) will work with the two law schools to put this in place in time for the next academic year. This will help foster the pro bono spirit in law students at an early stage as well as help them gain practical legal skills outside of the classroom. We are also considering with SILE how lawyers who do pro bono work can be better recognised. We are also increasing the number of internship places in the Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) to support the implementation of pro bono as a mandatory component of legal education. We are also actively growing the pool of Assigned Solicitors in LAB. In 2011, 50 new lawyers joined the pool. In the past, the volunteers tended to be from the smaller firms, and we are glad to note that a good number of the new volunteer assigned solicitors are coming from the large and medium-sized firms. I am also glad to note that the Law Society is expanding and enhancing its pro bono programmes. It is working on an online portal to match volunteers with pro bonoopportunities, developing a \"Pro Bono Friendly\" certification scheme for law practices, and these schemes, together with existing schemes such as the Community Legal Clinics and also those run by LAB, will provide structured opportunities for lawyers and law firms to do pro bono work. The Ministry of Law has been making financial contributions to the Law Society’s Pro Bono Services Office (PBSO). We are reviewing our contribution to PBSO to enable it to do more. We will also be expanding the Legal Aid Steering Committee (LASC) chaired by former Senior Minister of State for Law Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee. A wider cross-section of the legal community, including the judiciary, academia and practitioners, will be involved. This will bring key stakeholders in the legal community together in the Legal Aid Steering Committee to set the strategic direction for pro bono efforts and rally the legal community to do more pro bono work. Together, we hope these initiatives will help foster a greater spirit of giving within the legal profession and improve access to justice. Page: 2055 Next, on bankruptcy. Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Vikram Nair expressed concerns on the administration of bankruptcy cases. Currently, the Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office (IPTO) administers over 25,000 bankruptcy estates. IPTO’s staffing in its Individual Insolvency Division has been increased from 37 posts in 2009 to 74 now. IPTO is aware of the concerns such as those raised by Ms Lim and Mr Nair. We will continue to review the need for additional resources, always bearing in mind the cost to the public purse. IPTO is also looking for new ways to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of its processes. For example, in 2011, IPTO enhanced its bankruptcy case management system and introduced an electronic document management system, which digitises and routes public correspondence electronically to case officers, and facilitates monitoring by management. Later this month, IPTO will be launching an enhanced online platform for bankrupts and creditors to access case information, for example, claims made, and the amount available in the bankruptcy estate. Bankrupts can check the submission deadline for their Income and Expenditure Statements, and they can also check the status of their applications to travel overseas, manage businesses, or act as a company director. This service will be provided to bankrupts free of charge. Ms Lim asked if the Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS) may channel resources away from bankruptcy administration. As I shared with the House last month, the DRS is to allow debtors with regular incomes and debts not exceeding $100,000, an opportunity to avoid bankruptcy. This is part of IPTO’s work. Whether it is in administering bankruptcy cases or administering the DRS, IPTO will continue to look for efficiency gains in their operations. As for Mr Nair’s question, IPTO does and will continue to take into account the bankrupt’s inability to earn a living as a result of factors such as old age or ill health when evaluating the case for discharge. Other factors considered include the bankrupt’s conduct during bankruptcy, and the amount of contributions he has made to his bankruptcy estate. Next, on moneylenders. Both Mr Arthur Fong and Mr Chen Show Mao have spoken on the regulation of moneylenders and moneylending. We share their concerns, particularly over protecting the interests of borrowers. Allow me to first explain our approach in this area. There will always be people in need of credit and are unable to borrow from banks. Moneylenders meet this need. If we completely abolish the industry, it will only be driven underground, and borrowers will have no legal protection and will be at the mercy of loansharks. Our approach is to permit the industry to operate, but regulate it to give protection to borrowers, particularly those with lower incomes. What we have done in 2011 include the following: first, requiring moneylending licence applicants to pass a test on the Moneylending Act and Rules; we have also tightened the rules on moneylenders\\' business conduct − for instance, they may not obtain borrowers’ SingPass, bank account and other passwords. Sir, in Mandarin. 3.15 pm Page: 2056'], ['The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Sim Ann)', 'In November last year, MinLaw put in place new rules relating to moneylending advertisements. Recently, the Chinese press reported that new restrictions on advertisements by licensed moneylenders have led to a proliferation of advertisements by unlicensed moneylenders, which were misleading the public into believing that they were legal. Let me reiterate that the purpose of the rules is to prevent moneylending companies from using advertisements to stimulate excessive demand for loans by the public. In the past, we permitted licensed moneylenders to advertise in a variety of media, to allow the borrowers to compare terms across different moneylenders. However, we noticed that excessive advertising could stimulate excessive demand for loans amongst those who did not truly require them, resulting in unnecessary debt. Furthermore, borrowers needed to check the Registry of Moneylenders’ website to determine whether the advertisements were being put out by licensed or unlicensed moneylenders. We therefore put in new rules: if moneylending companies wish to advertise, they can only do so through business and consumer directories of services, their own websites, and through advertisements at their premises. They are not disallowed from advertising; they are only disallowed from unsolicited advertising. The new rules help the public differentiate between licensed and unlicensed moneylenders. Now the public no longer need to verify if the flyers, SMSes, emails or other forms of advertisements they received are from licensed moneylenders because they can be sure that all such activities are not allowed. Such advertisements would either be from licensed moneylenders operating in violation of our rules, or loansharks. Errant licensed moneylenders would be investigated by the Registry and loansharks would be investigated by the Police. We urge the public to avoid taking loans from them. We will continue to spread the message to let the public understand such unsolicited advertisement is illegal.'], ['The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Ms Sim Ann)', 'We have also been studying how to further strengthen our regulatory framework, and will be rolling out new measures to strengthen the regulation of the industry and the protection of borrowers. We will be amending the Moneylenders Act to strengthen the enforcement powers of the Registry of Moneylenders; safeguard borrowers’ information from unlicensed moneylenders; and clarify the provisions governing the moneylenders’ place of business. We have also been considering for some time changes to the Moneylenders Rules to further strengthen protection of borrowers, and these would address the concerns raised by Mr Fong and Mr Chen. The directions that we are considering include: requiring the use of Effective Interest Rate instead of Nominal Interest Rate; extending existing caps on interest rate to protect a larger range of borrowers; abolishing non-contingent fees which jack up the true cost of borrowing; and abolishing all exceptions to the limit on the amount of unsecured credit that a borrower can obtain, to close loopholes that could lead to excessive debt. I will give more details when moving the Second Reading of the Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill after the Committee of Supply debate. We will continue to watch the industry closely, and ensure that borrowers’ interests are adequately protected. Mr Desmond Lee raised several issues pertaining to community mediation in his cut. In particular, he asked if mediation could be made compulsory and if the CMC could be given powers to enforce community mediation. I thank him for pointing out a very important concern and I would like to assure him that we will be doing more. We are currently in discussions with frontline public agencies, for instance, the HDB, on several issues such as compelling the use of mediation for disputes in their purview and enforcing mediation agreements between parties. Mr Lee suggested that CMCs be given the power, similar to Courts, to bind parties for good behaviour. We will consider how best to do this in the context of the whole community mediation framework, and so I thank him for this.

I refer to the Minister’s remarks on my cut. First, on Internet regulation. The Minister said that somehow I suggested that the review was a pretext to censure. I think I need to put in context of what I am saying one more time. I referred to the US and its attempt to introduce legislation. I also referred to the Protection of Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) and Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). For example, PIPA, you have big corporate − US corporate and Internet corporate like Google − who actually spoke out against this Act. I was coming from that angle where there is a concern that while on the one hand, you protect intellectual property, such legislation to protect intellectual property could be used abusively and could even lead to censorship. That is where I was coming from. It was a point that I made in good faith, and I am not suggesting that the Working Committee somehow was looking for a reason to initiate legislation which would lead to censorship. That is not where I was coming from. On that note, can I just clarify, who are the members of this Working Committee that the Minister was referring to? I have to say that the cut really came from the comments that were made at the launch of \"The Mortal Enemy\". That was where the concern came up, because that was the first time I understood that the Government was in discussion with the Motion Pictures Association of America. So, that is where I was coming from. The second point about prosecutorial discretion −'], ['Mr Pritam Singh', 'Yes. On my second cut on prosecutorial discretion, I note the Minister’s comments, and I appreciate them. I did not make a case for introducing guidelines where the AGC is expected to release these guidelines to the public, as the Minister suggested. The real crux of the cut comes to the point of the punishment with regard to the offence that Ramalingam eventually was charged with, that is, the mandatory death penalty. Again, in good faith, if the AG would decide to come out and say, look, these are the reasons why we have decided not to review or to review, I think that may be helpful for the general public. That is really where I was coming from.'], ['Mr K Shanmugam', 'I thank Mr Singh for those remarks. First, there have been concerns expressed internationally that when you move legislation like what were proposed in the US that could affect freedom of speech or other concerns, my point would be: first, all that we have said is that we are studying this area. There is an inter-agency committee that is looking at it, and we must obviously look at the US’ experience and the experience of the others. I made it quite clear that we look at it from the perspective of the economic impact; should we do nothing, but we also need to consider the legitimate viewpoints that have been put up by users and others on a variety of issues. So, no decisions have been taken. It is being studied and, as I have indicated, as and when we reach a conclusion, then it will certainly be debated here. I only wanted to be quite clear that Mr Singh was not suggesting that we were using it as a pretext to cut down on freedom of speech because Mr Singh combined the word \"pretext\" with \"freedom of speech\", and I understood him to be suggesting that this exercise may be construed by some as a pretext. I am glad he clarified that he holds no such view. Page: 2058 Second, on prosecutorial discretion. I went through it quite carefully. You have two possibilities. The prosecution, under our Constitution, is given the discretion to make a decision on how offenders should be charged, and to make distinctions. That exercise of discretion has to be made in good faith, and it could be based on a number of factors, not all of which can be publicly disclosed, as the Court of Appeal itself recognised. For example, it could rely on intelligence; there could be real reasons why one person could be treated differently from another, but you cannot say it publicly. I said there are two possible models: one, we require the prosecution either to publish guidelines, but Mr Singh said that this is not what he was asking for, he wants the AGC to explain publicly. But after a series of times when you have explained publicly, it is as good as publishing the guidelines. So, it comes back to the same thing, and you come back to this issue that there are all these trade-offs. The prosecution sets out its decisions over a series of cases over many years. In such a case, we make a distinction; these are the reasons for the distinction. Then, you consider two alternate risks. The first risk is that the prosecution acts maliciously or wrongly in making distinctions between two people who ought not to be treated very differently. That is what society should guard against. That is a risk and I accept that it is a risk. On the other hand, there is a risk that criminals would start looking at those published reasons and work out how the exercise of prosecutorial discretion will take place, and then they will start gaming the system. So, you have to assess, this House has to assess, which is the more serious risk and which is better for society. My assessment, and the assessment of the many professionals involved, is that the risk that the prosecution will act wrongly is far less serious compared with the possibility that people or criminals will start gaming the system. And, do not forget, ultimately, the Court of Appeal has indicated that where on the face of it, the distinction that the prosecution makes between two different accused, if it cries out for an explanation and the prosecution offers no explanation, then the Court will make inferences. So, that is a further check and safeguard as well. We are all here trying to work towards a better criminal justice system, and we believe the current approach strikes the appropriate balance between the different interests involved. But, as I have indicated more than once in my explanations, if we believe that requiring the prosecution to explain its reasons publicly, either by way of published guidelines or by way of a case-by-case response, if we believe that that is better, we will amend the Constitution. That is a no brainer and I say that unhesitatingly. Page: 2059'], ['Ms Sylvia Lim', 'Sir, two points for the Minister for Law, in relation to my cut on criminal procedure. First, in his response, he suggested that my description of the Kadarcase as a breakthrough was not quite fair − I am summarising what he is saying. Or rather, he mentioned that in the CPC review resulting in the Code in 2010, there had already been big steps taken towards discovery and so the Kadar case is supposed to be part of that, if I can just maybe dilute the statement. But does the Minister not agree that actually nowhere in the CPC 2010, does it require in its wording for the prosecution to disclose to the defence, evidence which it does not intend to use as part of its case? That is not present in any of the provisions, specifically in the CPC. That is why the Kadar judgement talks about common law duty to disclose evidence which prosecution does not intend to use. The second clarification which I like to seek from the Minister is whether the Attorney-General’s Chambers has actually issued any guidelines to the Police on what they should disclose to the prosecution, post-Kadar judgement and, if it has issued some written guidelines, would it consider making them public? If not in entirety, at least some sanitised version which I think will go a long way to promote public confidence in the system.'], ['Mr K Shanmugam', 'Sir, I made no comments on Ms Lim’s statement about the Kadar judgement being a breakthrough. I think Ms Lim would recall a few weeks ago that I said in this House that most lawyers would consider that the Kadar judgement rightly expresses the law, and that expresses my view. In terms of what the CPC 2010 does, I made the point that it significantly enhanced the rights of the accused in terms of the discovery obligations on both sides, and I think that made for a better criminal justice procedure. It does not, in terms, in the statutory provisions, refer to unused materials, but that was a matter of debate during the Second Reading, and if I may quote myself, I think for the second or third time, as to what I said then − and Ms Lim could not have forgotten it – this was what I said, \"Lawyers appearing in Court, whether prosecution or defence lawyers, are officers of the Court. If they deliberately suppress material evidence, they would be acting in gross breach of their duties. One cannot put forward evidence in Court while holding back other evidence which could put a different complexion on the evidence that is in fact being tendered in Court.\" I have no doubt that the Court would take a serious view of such conduct. Ms Lim knows that the Court of Appeal referred to that statement and said that it expressed their view correctly and, in fact, relied on that statement to express its own views. So, the law is clear. We are both involved on the same side, as it were, to try and improve the administration of criminal justice. Whether or not it is expressed in terms in the Statute, this is what was said as being the law, and this was accepted by the Court of Appeal as being the law. There is no doubt about it. I think I have answered both Ms Lim’s questions. 3.30 pm'], ['Ms Sylvia Lim', 'Sir, the second clarification.'], ['Mr K Shanmugam', 'In terms of Police guidelines, both before and post-Kadar, the approach the prosecution has taken has always been that Police investigating officers conduct the investigations and the material they collect is gone through for relevance. They have supervising officers who look through it, and that is then brought to the Attorney-General’s Chambers and there are guidelines on the kind of material that should be produced. In fact, everything that they collect should be reviewed by a Legal Officer within the Attorney-General’s Chambers. So, they have fairly clear guidelines on how they work with each other. Page: 2060 But, I must say, whether it is private practice or the Attorney-General’s Chambers or the Police Force, any system that is operated by human beings, there can be lapses. That is not to say no lapses will ever occur. But we have systems in place that try to minimise these lapses. Ultimately, the Attorney-General’s Chambers and lawyers are answerable to the Court to practise to the best standards of the profession.'], ['Ms Sylvia Lim', 'Thank you, Sir. Just to clarify again, Minister, you did not answer my question as to whether Government would consider publishing the guidelines or at least a sanitised version of the guidelines for the public to understand more about the system and to have some assurance of the rigour of the discovery.'], ['Mr K Shanmugam', 'Publishing which guidelines?'], ['Ms Sylvia Lim', 'Any guideline that is issued by the Attorney-General’s Chambers to the Police on what they should disclose to the prosecution.'], ['Mr K Shanmugam', 'Everything that the Police collect needs to be disclosed to the prosecution, and then the prosecution needs to apply its mind to see what is relevant.'], ['Mr Hri Kumar Nair', 'Sir, I would like to thank the Minister and his team for their clear and comprehensive responses, and to the officers and staff in the Ministry for their good work. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. The sum of $199,958,800 for Head R ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates. The sum of $340,236,700 for Head R ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.']]\n",
      "sprs3topic_reportid=budget-1630.html\n",
      "[['Dr Tan Wu Meng', 'Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head O of the Estimates be reduced by $100\". I declare that I am a medical doctor in a public hospital. Sir, in the Budget debate, I spoke about preparing for the next pandemic. Today, I will speak on delivering healthcare to our fellow Singaporeans and supporting our sisters and brothers working on the healthcare frontline. I will speak on five areas today: (a) seniors\\' access to care; (b) care coordination; (c) care-givers; (d) IT and design in healthcare; and (e) our healthcare frontliners. Sir, on seniors\\' mobility and access to care. In an ageing society, we have more Singaporeans with mobility needs. Some stay in older flats with multiple steps at the doorway, flats where the steps are too high for the usual Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme organised by HDB. Has MOH studied whether seniors in such households are more likely to miss medical appointments? Has MOH looked at how to better support such seniors so they can more easily get to the clinic so that chronic diseases can be brought under control better and so that hospital admissions can be reduced by going upstream? Can MOH look into better support for home delivery of medications? Because this too will reduce the need for seniors with limited mobility to make multiple outpatient trips. Sir, my second point on care coordinators. On my Clementi home visits, I have met residents who have many, many medical appointments. One old lady told me she has 10 clinic visits in the upcoming, next three months. Each of them will mean her daughter has to take time off from work to accompany her to and from the clinic for the appointment. With an ageing population and shrinking family sizes, this poses a challenge for many seniors in the community. In some cases, the son or daughter cannot take leave or has used up all of their annual leave, or the family member may be a low-wage worker, daily-rated, which means time away from work becomes loss of income. Many patients today are older, with more medical conditions—more complex medical conditions. Sometimes three, four, five – even more – medical teams look after the same patient. Sir, there is a role for more patient navigators and more care coordinators linking up across different care teams to help coordinate the care better, to help reduce the multiplication of medical appointments, to help make it easier for appointments to be brought onto the same day, where possible. We can look at reimagining our healthcare so as to support this better. Sir, I am told that IMH has a team of patient care coordinators and, over the years, their experience has been that this reduces the number of patients needing admission. There are lessons we can learn for coordinating care across other medical conditions as well. Sir, my third point on supporting care-givers. Some years ago, as a young doctor, I looked after an old lady with advanced cancer. She was very, very sick and not getting better. Her 50-year old son quit his job to look after her. He quit his job to look after his mother. Later, she passed away. Her son\\'s duty was done. But he had a lot of difficulty. He found it so hard getting back into the workforce in his fifties. Yet this man, this filial caring son, had shown dedication and devotion to duty, day and night, looking after his mother who was terminally ill. Dedication, devotion, duty, but unfortunately, potential employers did not see it that way. They asked, \"What is this gap in your CV? Why were you out of the workforce?\" They did not see the dedication and devotion to duty. Sir, I call upon MOH to work with MSF and MOM to look at how we can better support care-givers – both during the journey of care-giving, and especially when a care-giver is trying to get back into the workforce. Together, across the Ministries, together with industry, and with our brothers and sisters in the Unions, we can find ways to build awareness among employers and even go the extra mile to recognise inclusive employers, who hire fellow Singaporeans who are returning to the workforce having spent time as care-givers showing that dedication and devotion to duty. Sir, my fourth point on IT and design in healthcare. Chairman, when we empower our healthcare workers, when we look at what is happening on the ground and empower workers on the ground to do their jobs better, it helps patients as well. It improves the quality of care. It improves the patient experience. Sir, Information Technology, or IT, has transformed healthcare around the world, but we also must continue looking at how IT is implemented and designed. For example, digital ordering of tests today. Is it faster, easier, than ticking boxes and signing a piece of paper? If it is not, we must ask ourselves why and how can it be improved? Electronic records today. Do they speed things up, so healthcare workers can spend more time, more quality time with patients? Or is there still room for improvement? And if so, why and how can we make it better? Computer workstations today, the design of workstations today, computers, do they help doctors and nurses maintain eye contact with the patient? Comfort the patients, especially in a world with COVID-19, where everyone is wearing a mask and that eye contact becomes even more important. Does it help that eye contact happen? Or is it sometimes a different experience? And if so why, and how can we make it better? So, I ask the Ministry, has MOH done any recent studies on the design of healthcare facilities, healthcare IT and the patient experience? Some designers talk about time-movement studies. How much time it takes to get a task done? How much movement is needed to make something happen? Has there been any recent ergonomic research to see what brings more comfort to patients and better performance for healthcare workers? Sir, these studies may not be easy to do. But what we do not study, what we no not look at, what we do not search for, we do not know. We must seek truth from facts. Sir, Steve Jobs was co-founder of Apple, and well known for his sense of design and aesthetics. Every iPhone user everyone who uses a modern multi-touch smartphone, sees the impact of his influence and legacy on industrial design. His younger sister Mona wrote in the New York Times shortly after he passed away. She wrote about how Steve Jobs, from his hospital bed, as a patient battling terminal cancer, wanted to make the hospital better. Sketching devices to hold an iPad in a hospital bed, designing new fluid monitors and X-ray equipment, re-drawing the design of a hospital unit. Not every one of us can be Steve Jobs, but every patient brings an important perspective to the healthcare journey. And when we see better through the eyes of our patients, when we see better through the eyes of our healthcare workers on the ground, we continually see better and better ways to improve our healthcare system. We can apply the same care and attention and passion to re-imagining the design of healthcare facilities, re-imagining the user experience so healthcare workers can do the job even better, care for patients even better. Whether it is a hospital computer system, the healthcare workplace, or the patient journey. Seeing through the eyes of our people. Sir, I want to speak about our healthcare frontliners. In particular, I want to salute our nurses and allied health workers. Every doctor knows this instinctively, even before they become a doctor from their days as a medical student. The impact our nurses have, lifting up the lives of our patients making a difference for every patient. Every patient, every care-giver understands this too. And I say this both as a doctor and as the son of a patient. We see the impact that our nurses have, that care, that dedication, that heart. Nursing is also deeply skilled work, deeply skilled work and essential work. Last year during the debate on the President\\'s Address, I called upon MOH to look at paying our nurses and allied health workers more and I am glad the Finance Minister has announced better salaries for our sisters and brothers in nursing. Some years ago, I attended a healthcare conference. One of the speaker was the President and CEO of the Duke University Hospital in the USA. He is a nurse, trained as an Oncology nurse, rose up through the ranks to lead the hospital, to lead an entire healthcare system in the USA. We should continue looking at ways to further empower our nurses in Singapore to create more opportunities for upskilling and advancement, as we all work together to lift up the lives of our patients. Sir, I also want to speak on another group of healthcare frontliners who are key to keeping us safe. These are some of our outsourced healthcare frontline workers. Our hospital cleaners, our healthcare attendants are an integral part of the health care workforce. They are integral to the hospital. Facing the COVID-19 risks together, serving on the same front line as medical nursing and allied health staff serving together. Once upon a time all these brothers and sisters were directly hired by the hospitals and not outsourced. Today, a growing number of cleaners and healthcare attendants have been outsourced. But, Sir, the rationale for outsourcing hospital cleaners and hospital attendants is not compelling. It is not compelling. First of all, the demand for hospital cleaners and hospital attendants is the same throughout the year. There is no seasonal component involved. It does not vary much throughout the year. And in a COVID-19 world, it makes sense for team members to stay based within the same healthcare institution rather than moving from place to place amidst a pandemic. We are already providing outsourced cleaners with protective gear during COVID-19. It recognises that they are part of the same healthcare frontline. And there is something to be said for treating all our hospital cleaners and healthcare attendants as part of the in-house staff, making them feel more fully like part of the team, supporting resourcing, uplifting these workers together accordingly. Because, Sir, when we are fighting on the COVID-19 frontline, we are all in this together. We should think about hospital cleaners, our hospital attendants as part of the whole healthcare team and not as a service to be outsourced. Furthermore, Sir, direct hiring also makes it easier for hospitals to create additional jobs and job opportunities to hire directly from the community nearby. In my Meet-the-People Sessions in Clementi, I have met older workers who have been retrenched, who are looking for job placements in healthcare institutions nearby. We should look at ways for hospitals to generate employment for residents living nearby as well. I call upon the Ministry to consider this outsourcing issue as one of the issues which COVID-19 is forcing societies around the world to re-think. Chairman, healthcare is about \"health\" and \"care\" supporting our patients, supporting our care-givers, supporting our healthcare workers –our sisters and brothers on the healthcare frontline. It is about keeping all of us safe, keeping all of us safe together. And so, may we continue building a healthier Singapore as we fight this COVID-19 pandemic as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic together. Question proposed.'], ['Mr Yip Hon Weng', 'Chairman, achieving herd immunity through COVID-19 vaccinations is important to our economy and livelihoods. Since the first vaccination roll-out in December, what are the latest statistics pertaining to the percentage of eligible recipients who are vaccinated? How many eligible seniors have been vaccinated? Even with the commencement of the vaccination programme for senior citizens, some of my senior residents shared that they are adopting the wait-and-see approach. I cite some of the most common reasons pertaining to their decision. They are worried about immediate side effects. Moreover, the two approved vaccines in Singapore are based on a novel technology, so the long-term effects are unknown. Some are also questioning the need for vaccination as the community infection rates are low. They may not go for the vaccination if there is no need for a vaccination certificate to travel. Is outreach also extended to younger Singaporeans pertaining to elderly vaccinations? Some elderly said that their children or grandchildren discouraged them from taking it. This is because their children are worried that the vaccinations have dangerous implications on seniors with health complications. How does MOH plan to encourage more seniors in the community to get vaccinated?'], ['Mr Ang Wei Neng', 'The National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) was officially opened in September 2019, just a few months before Singapore detected the first confirmed case of COVID-19. Thereafter, NCID played a crucial role in battling COVID-19. On the whole, Singapore has done relatively well in controlling the number of community cases as compared to our neighbouring countries, Asia and the rest of the world. Certainly, we are not perfect and can do better with the benefit of hindsight. For example, we could have advised Singaporeans to wear reusable masks earlier. Also, the outbreak of COVID-19 at the foreign worker\\'s dormitories caught us by surprise. We could have moved in earlier to improve their living conditions. Having said that, COVID-19 will not be our last pandemic. We need to document the main learning points of managing COVID-19 and learn from it. Will MOH work with the multi-ministerial task force to conduct a review and release an interim post-mortem report? This would be similar to what the MOF did by releasing the \"Interim Assessment of the Impact of Key COVID-19 Budget Measures\". We know that the pandemic is not over yet, but an interim report will be important as what has transpired in the past year is still fresh in our memory. More importantly, we would like to know how MOH and Singapore could be better prepared for the next disease X. The COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on healthcare services and facilities. I am concerned with two aspects. First, COVID-19 has delayed the construction of healthcare facilities in Singapore, but the growth in our ageing population is marching on. What contingency plan does MOH have to deal with the delay in building hospitals, polyclinics and nursing homes? Second, I am concern about the difficulty in employing domestic helpers to care for the elderly. Many Nanyang residents have approached me to appeal for elder care or nursing home facilities, because of the challenges in bringing in domestic helpers to Singapore. This is probably a nation-wide problem. How can the MOH cope with this sudden surge in demand, especially with the delay in the construction of nursing homes? Besides the need for nursing homes for elderly that are not able to take care of themselves, there is also a strong interest from the more abled elderly to age in their own homes. Many are interested in Singapore’s first Community Care Apartments in Bukit Batok, which are affordable housing with senior-friendly features. I understand that it is 4.2 times oversubscribed. Since the take-up rate is so strong, will MOH and MND consider offering more of such flats at the next quarter or so?'], ['Mr Leon Perera', \"Mr Chairman, Sir, from a recent reply to my Parliamentary Question, we now know that residents aged 25 years old with below Secondary education have a life expectancy 5.8 years lower than that with those with post-Secondary education. I thank the Minister for Health for the detailed answer. We also learnt that people with below Secondary education have a greater likelihood of chronic illnesses like diabetes and high cholesterol. Sir, for many of my lower income constituents, convenient and cheap food options are unhealthy ones, like instant noodles. Research shows poverty often overwhelms one's cognitive ability to make good decisions on health. I, thus, speak on the urgent need to tackle health inequality. It would seem that the prevalence of conditions like obesity, diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol has risen over the years. Sir, I would suggest that there is an urgent need to revamp for preventive healthcare efforts, particularly for poorer Singaporeans. While many efforts have been undertaken, the outcome seems to be moving in the opposite direction. To achieve better outcomes, we need better measurement. Firstly, could we make public more timely and comprehensive data of chronic diseases by socio-economic groups? Other than the response to my recent Parliamentary Question for what I understand the most recent publicly available data on health risks, behaviours and outcomes by socio-economic class was 2010 National Health Survey. The National Registry of Diseases already collects data on the incidence of cancer and chronic kidney failure. It is an easy next step to include SES indicators like income and education. We must also study the entire life cycle of chronic diseases. Are low-income groups contracting more diseases, more severe diseases or even earlier diseases? Secondly, can we make more data public and healthcare outcomes for low-income groups? Are they receiving a later diagnosis with poorer outcomes compared to wealthy Singaporeans who can choose top tier private care, for example? I am not suggesting that this is the case but it would be useful to have the data. Some doctors have observed COVID-19-related backlogs and patients transferring from private to public to save money, pressuring the public system and lengthening waiting times for subsidised patients. Thirdly, could we develop a National Health Equity Index? This could be created by an independent group of academics and include social determinants of health as well as health care accessibility, affordability and outcomes. This will pinpoint areas for targeted action. Once we have more data, we must act decisively. I note that HPB piloted the Healthy Living Passports Scheme in mid-2020 and aim to reach 15,000 lower income residents over three years. How effective have the incentives been among lower income groups? Other than the number of participants, can we targets in terms of better health outcomes? The National Health Screening Programme, Screen for Life, heavily subsidies screening for some conditions. What is the take-up rate and outcomes thus far, particularly for those who are less advantaged socio-economically? Mr Chairman, Sir, we must improve outcomes at the intersection of health inequality and preventive health care. Not only because we have a responsibility to the less fortunate but also because this problem creates spill-over effects that can cause society more if left untreated.\"], ['Mr Leong Mun Wai', 'Chairman, escalating healthcare cost is a major worry for Singaporeans. Since cost is a result of the prices set by the public healthcare institutions, the pricing principles of the public sector is of great interest to us. Is public health pricing based on average cost or marginal cost? What are the various cost components incorporated in those costs? Is the cost-based price checked against the pricing of other countries? What are the other considerations in determining the final price? And how does MOH monitor and change the pricing overtime? Only with this information can we make an informed judgement whether MOH’s services expenditures of about $11 billion which represents about 2.2% of our GDP, is enough or not. Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang): Chairman, it is not uncommon for us to hear senior residents complaining about 可以病，不可以死。可以死，不可以病。Which means that can fall ill but cannot die. Singapore has one of the best healthcare systems in the world but it does not come cheap. This is evident from the effectiveness of our COVID-19 response and is further reinforced by the fact that Singaporeans enjoy one of the highest life expectancies in the world – that is 83.8 years for 2021. But with rapid medical technological and pharmaceutical advances, costs of healthcare delivery have increased exponentially. In 2018, medical inflation was at 10%,10 times more than the general inflation rate in Singapore. But this appears to be a global situation. The average global medical inflation rate was observed at 9.7% that year. As the population ages, more spending on healthcare will be required and the rate of medical inflation will need to be checked. How is MOH keeping track of the medical inflation trend and looking into its impact on Singaporeans? The average Singaporean household expenses on healthcare costs in 2017 and 2018 were found to have increased by 4.5 to 5.5 percentage point as from five years ago. The actual increase differs slightly across different income groups, and it is somewhat concerning that the below income group, the lowest 20% bracket saw their healthcare costs forming the largest portion which is 7.8% of their household expenses. How much does the average Singaporean household spend on healthcare? And how does it compare to other developed countries? Are our current MediSave contributions keeping pace with the medical inflation? Our \"3M\" framework public financing healthcare plays a crucial role to keep quality of health care affordable for all. The Deputy Prime Minister has announced that there will higher remuneration for our nurses and healthcare support staff, which I fully concur with. So, we must now also examine how to fund the inevitable increases in healthcare expenses. With our ageing population, our elderly will be saddled with more healthcare costs pertaining to illness. Last year, I voiced my concerns for senior citizens who had to pay upfront cash for age-related medical treatments. I would like to suggest that medical usage limits be tiered according to age to ensure our elderly residents\\' growing healthcare needs are met. Naturally, we must ensure MediSave contributions would commensurate with the higher medical expenses. When is our last review of our MediSave contributions? Will the Ministry do a review on our current \"3M\" health financing strategy to ensure all Singaporeans will be adequately covered and keep up with medical inflation?'], ['Ms Hazel Poa', 'Mr Chairman, MediSave limits are a major concern for the elderly and it is the issue I have been asked most frequently to raise. Many feel that the annual limits of $200 or $500 are inadequate for their needs, given current healthcare costs. In November last year, Senior Minister of State said that MediSave limits are being reviewed. Can the Minister provide an update on the status of the review? At the moment, MediSave can be used mainly for hospitalisation and in-patient treatment with limited outpatient treatments allowed. Limiting MediSave to mainly in-patient treatment skews demand towards hospitalisation. Outpatient treatment is cheaper and can manage disease before they worsen and become more costly to treat. If we can allow MediSave to be used more widely on out-patient treatments, we can shift demand towards the lower cost outpatient treatments and help control healthcare costs. Can the Minister consider expanding the range of outpatient treatments allowed to use MediSave?'], ['Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song', 'Many seniors suffer from chronic conditions which require extended care and that can be very expensive. Most outpatient treatment is not covered by MediShield Life and access to MediFund is only available to the very low income. The use of MediSave is subject to annual withdrawal caps. This can have an undesirable effect of discouraging seniors from seeking early treatment. Can MOH allow MediSave withdrawals for the treatment of all chronic conditions, not just those under the Chronic Disease Management Programme list to ensure that no one is excluded just because they suffer from a less common chronic condition? And can MOH remove annual withdrawal limits on the use of MediSave of patients over 60 years old, who have a balance of at least $5,000 in their MediSave accounts? This can be rolled out at polyclinics, restructured hospitals and CHAS clinics where tight procedures are already in place to ensure that only medically necessary treatment is prescribed.'], ['Ms Ng Ling Ling', 'Chairman, the Government has responded decisively in deploying resources to combat the COVID-19 pandemic with healthcare expenditures increased significantly to provide for our public health management measures. However, even without the pandemic, we know that the healthcare expenditure has been rising globally. Globally, we are also seeing similar trends in developed countries due to increasing medical attention, medication, procedures and longer hospital stays from an ageing population. In Singapore, the Government has been working on making our health care accessible and affordable through investing in medical infrastructure, establishing \"P\" benchmarks, providing various subsidies, as well as working with Singaporeans to encourage a healthy lifestyle. This has worked well for Singaporeans thus far. But we cannot ignore the rising healthcare costs that Singaporeans may face. How can we continue to provide higher value in healthcare in the face of rising healthcare costs and ageing population and advances in medical procedures? Sir, I hope that the Government can consider value-based healthcare as another lever to help manage overall costs of healthcare for Singaporeans. Value in healthcare is generated by delivering better health outcomes for the same or a lower cost. While our healthcare costs have been rising each year, we currently do not have a very clear grasp if healthcare outcomes of major or common diseases, such as diabetes or asthma have been improving. Healthcare providers have typically been paid on a fee-for-service model with subvention given mainly by volume. The objective of health, value-based healthcare, is to create financial incentive to encourage providers to improve the health value given to patients. One example is from Sweden\\'s National Health System where they piloted a bundled payment model for cataract and hip replacement procedure. The bundle sets a single base price that covers the entire care delivery chain from diagnostic surgery to follow-up visits. Providers are paid based on whether they met pre-defined health outcomes to the patient. This has helped in the pilot years for complications to decrease by 18% re-operations to fall by 23%. I acknowledge that there are no silver bullets to address the rising healthcare costs. Nonetheless. I hope that the Government will consider value-based healthcare incentive approach as an important part of the short and long-term strategy to achieve better healthcare value for Singaporeans.'], ['Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song', 'Between 2016 and 2019, $7.5 billion in premiums for MediShield Life were collected and $3.5 billion in claims were paid out, while a further $3 billion was set aside for future premium rebates. Many Singaporeans are concerned about the impending premium hikes of up to 35% to MediShield Life. More transparency on the data and assumptions used will help to better to explain these premium hikes. Last November, in response to my request for the release of the full MediShield Life actuarial report, Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon, said that MOH may engage different consultants to challenge the assumptions and do another calculation and publish some of this data in an academic way. Will the full MediShield Life actuarial report be provided to these consultants and academics for further analysis? And if so, when will this be done? Lastly, I note that the new MediShield Life premiums have kicked in on 1 of March. Can MOH consider postponing the increased premiums until our economy recovers?'], ['Ms Hazel Poa', 'Mr Chairman, the issue of portable health insurance was raised by Health Correspondent Salma Khalik in December last year. Currently, many Singaporeans have integrated plans. As a person gets older, it becomes difficult to move from one insurer to another. This is because people develop medical problems as they grow older. When they tried to switch insurers, they generally face the prospect of these pre-existing conditions being excluded from cover. As a result, beyond a certain age, it becomes practically impossible for people to switch to another insurer even if there is a big difference in premiums paid. Theoretically, insurers can entice younger people with much lower premiums and later hike the premiums significantly when they are older and unable to switch insurers due to their pre-existing conditions. Will the Minister consider ensuring that IPs are fully portable by making it a condition for IP providers to allow policy holders to switch providers without imposing additional conditions?'], ['Dr Tan Yia Swam', 'Mr Chairman, Sir, I need to first declare conflict of interest as a general surgeon in private practice, with an interest in breast surgery; and my role as the elected President of Singapore Medical Association. Escalating healthcare costs is a concern for many governments. In Singapore, this has gained much attention recently with questions raised by the public on private insurance agents. In truth, managing healthcare costs is a complex problem. Learned economists have studied it, and there is no simple answer. I see a need for everyone to be part of the solution. I list five key factors: (a) advances in technology leading to better quality of care; (b) healthcare facilities costs, (c) doctors\\' fees; (d) patient health-seeking behaviour; and (e) insurers. As research and experimental trials become validated, the advances will be accepted in mainstream clinical practice. One simple example in my field – 30 years ago, most breast cancer patients had to accept a mastectomy, and the resulting change in appearance was unacceptable to some. Now, patients can opt for nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction which allow the patient to regain a physical appearance which is similar to her normal. This means a better outcome for some patients, but clearly, increase costs. Who monitors the costs of the private healthcare facilities? As a patient, when I receive the itemised bill, how do I know which of these items are reasonably charged, and which are not? Doctors\\' fees have often been blamed as the main source of increased costs. How true is this? Historically, SMA had a guideline of fees since 1987, which had to be removed in 2007, as it was deemed anti-competitive. MOH announced in end 2017 that fee benchmarks will be implemented. Since then, the benchmarks serve as a guide on how doctors charge. Patient health-seeking behaviour also affects costs. When people fall sick, how do they choose their care? Just take a panadol and rest? See a General Practitioner? See a TCM physician? Do they go to a polyclinic, the emergency department or straight to a specialist? Finally, how are insurers involved? Patients factor in financial costs when they need to see a doctor. Some will go only to their company doctors based on their corporate insurances with no need to pay out of pocket. When they need to have hospital admissions, day surgery or major operations, that is when their Integrated Shield Plans will come in useful. In my Budget debate speech, I highlighted the importance of shared decision making in healthcare. We are in the age of patient empowerment. This has been so for quite a few years with an increasingly better educated population. The Judiciary has acknowledged this trend when they introduced the Modified Montgomery Test and the understanding was reinforced by this Government when the Civil Law Act was amended last year. Patients must be adequately informed before they make a choice on the medical care that they want to receive. I am all for this and medical practitioners here have been making adjustments in the way they practise, in order that patients are better informed and empowered. Likewise, insurers need to share more information and allow their clients to make informed decisions. From time to time, I get asked by friends and relatives about health insurance, especially Integrated Shield Plans or IPs in short. These questions include – which IP provider is better, and which IP plan provided by the provider is more suited to my needs? I must admit I am ill-equipped to answer these questions. I myself am insured with an IP, but I must confess that when I bought it many years ago, I did not make a detailed comparison of the various IP providers\\' offerings, but trusted my financial advisor\\'s recommendation. Close to 70% of Singapore Residents buy IPs. So, IPs affect the majority of us living here. It is therefore important that Singaporeans are adequately informed upfront by the various IP insurers before they make a decision to buy an IP, or before they make a decision to switch IP providers, since IPs are bought annually. I ask myself, what would I like to know before I made a decision to buy a certain IP or not. These are the most important questions that will make me choose one IP provider over another. One, what are the premiums for me now and when I get older? Two, what are the benefits and claim limits of each plan offered? Three, what percentage of private sector specialists are empanelled by a certain IP provider? Four, does the IP provider allow me to go to any private hospital in Singapore? Five, are all restructured hospital specialists automatically empanelled? Six, how does the IP provider pay specialists; does it follow MOH fee benchmarks? I realised that other than the first two questions, information was difficult or impossible to obtain for me to make an informed decision on which IP to purchase. Questions about empanelling are important because ultimately, it is about choice. The IP provider that offers more choices is more attractive to a potential IP customer. The last question about how IP insurers pay specialists is important in an indirect way. A system that reimburses private sector specialists adequately is more sustainable and better for me as a policyholder, in the long run. More specialists will want to be empanelled with this IP provider and I will have a wider choice. If my IP insurer does not pay the specialist fairly or adequately, how would the doctor feel? We can use the MOH fee benchmarks as a good guide for this. How does each IP provider pay specialists for procedures? Does a certain IP insurer pay up to the higher limit of the benchmarks, or the lower limit, or up to the mid-point? Or does this IP insurer reimburse at rates that are even lower than the lower limit of MOH fee benchmarks? It should be a warning sign to policyholders when an IP provider pays doctors below or only at the lower limit of the MOH benchmarks. I think the regulators of IPs, which are MAS and MOH, can obtain the answers to these six questions from IP insurers and present them in a tabulated and easily digestible form that members of the public can refer to when they make their decisions on which IP to buy. This will advance the cause of patient education and empowerment. A more difficult but important policy question to ask is what proportion of Singapore Residents should buy IP. The combined market share of private hospitals and A class and B1 class beds in Restructured Hospitals is estimated to be in the range of 30% to 35%. Yet the proportion of Singapore Residents buying an IP is nearing 70%. This is an unusual phenomenon in the running of a health insurance system. In the normal scheme of things, healthy insurance policyholders subsidise policyholders who fall sick and make claims. But in our IP environment, the business of IP is cross-subsidised not just by those who do not fall sick, but by those who fall sick and yet choose to be treated at subsidised B2 and C classes in restructured hospitals when they are entitled to more under their IPs. At the superficial level, it would appear that there is nothing wrong with this because it is the patient\\'s choice and it is good to be prudent. However, there is an externality cost, when IP holders choose subsidised wards in the restructured hospitals when they fall sick. The consumption of these Government subsidies are indirectly subsidising the insurers\\' IP businesses and depriving patients-in-need of more subsidies, since MOH\\'s budget is a finite thing. These Government subsidies would not have been consumed had the patients chose what they were entitled to, to be treated in the private hospitals or in A or B1 class wards. Another important corollary of this unusual phenomenon is that it further lengthens the waiting times for subsidised services in restructured hospitals. I think it is important that we study this \"voluntary downgrading\" phenomenon so that we can ensure that the IP environment today is functioning faithfully to the original policy intent of IPs. Also, what is the desired proportion of Singapore residents who should buy IPs. Is it the current 65% to 70%? Or below or above this range? I do not know the correct figure, but with a private sector market share of only 30% to 35%, including B1 and A class beds in restructured hospitals, the corresponding figure of 70% of the population having IPs sounds rather high. Can the private sector support the needs of this 70% if all of them who fell ill chose the unsubsidised services they are entitled to under their IPs? I have a few patients who themselves are insurance agents, and they realise they do not quite know what they are covered for. Are all insurance agents well trained and up-to-date about the products they are selling? Are the medical underwriters also keeping their medical knowledge up to date? I raise one specific and very common example in my field: a healthy lady in her 20s with no family history is offered a free health screening when she signs up for an IP, including ultrasound of the breasts. This picks up a 3-mm nodule, too small to categorise. This lady is then informed that she will be excluded from breast cancer coverage. Thereafter, there is a cycle of her agent asking her to see a doctor, the doctor telling her it is likely benign and can observe. The agent may then ask for a memo to state that she does not have cancer. I have met patients where they state that the agent has asked them to pay for the surgery themselves to remove the lump, and then appeal to be covered. As a breast surgeon, I do not know how to help this group of affected women. There are no good medical indications for any of these. In summary, escalating healthcare costs is a complex problem, and the medical professional bodies are ready to be part of the solution through honest, open discussion. I call for increased transparency and accountability of insurance companies and their agents. MOH and the SMC scrutinise doctors. Who is scrutinising the other players in the healthcare costs equation?'], ['Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang', 'Sir, in 2013, the Government started allowing the use of MediSave for IVF, subject to a withdrawal limit per cycle and per patient. Recently, many couples have called for an increase in these limits to better meet IVF costs. MOH has said, \"Couples who find themselves unable to cope with unexpectedly large bills, for instance, as a result of complications, even after co-funding, may appeal to use MediSave beyond the current limits\" on a case-by-case basis. It has been over seven years since we reviewed these withdrawal limits. I hope we can conduct a review and consider increasing the limits on the use of MediSave for IVF and not just on a case-by-case basis. IVF is a costly procedure. It would be a pity for couples who are unable to afford it but have funds in their MediSave, to be denied the gift of parenthood. In the dialogues I have organised on IVF, many couples told me that they have achieved better results from supplementing their IVF treatments with TCM. Some doctors recommend TCM treatment for certain patients as it may optimise results. TCM treatments such as acupuncture can act as a supplementary method for patients to increase their chances of success. My wife also, upon the advice of our doctor, did TCM during our IVF treatments. Some might say that TCM does not work, while others say it does, but we can all agree that it does help provide an ease of mind, that we have tried everything we can do to have a successful IVF cycle. TCM can be expensive. Couples I have spoken to end up spending around $500 to $1,000 a month, on top of already mounting IVF costs. Can we allow couples to use their MediSave which they are allowed to use for IVF and subject to the current withdrawal limits, for TCM treatments associated with IVF? Last month, I proposed extending co-funding to the seventh and eighth IVF cycles to support couples who need more cycles to conceive successfully. MOH responded that, \"We also need to balance the need to meaningfully and responsibly allocate public funds on this.\" In this case, rather than provide additional funding after the sixth cycle, will MOH allow co-funding leftover from the first six subsidised IVF cycles to be rolled over into the seventh and eighth cycle? Can it also allow any co-funding leftover from the three subsidised fresh cycles to be used for the subsidised frozen cycles? These are funds the Government has already budgeted for. It is win-win solution as it allows couples to complete additional cycles using subsidies that we have already budgeted for without additional allocation needed.'], ['Ms Ng Ling Ling', \"Chairman, as we dedicate 2021 as the year of celebrating SG women and as a mother myself, I would like to dedicate this cut to bring attention to the health of pregnant women and how it can affect our children. Both overseas and local research have pointed to the impact of maternal health on the health of our children. One of such findings is from a homegrown Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes or GUSTO study conducted by researchers in the National University Health System, KK Women's and Children's Hospital and A*STAR Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences over the last 10 years. The study found that one in five mothers-to-be develop gestational diabetes and this heightened the risk of their children developing obesity Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and even neurodevelopmental disorder later in their lives. Another concern pointed out by the study is the mental health of pregnant women. Mental well-being of mothers-to-be will also affect children, who are likely to develop neuro-developmental disorders such as anxiety, depression or disruptive behaviour disorders. We know that causes for these diseases can be multi-faceted and complex, including the pregnant mothers' own health and her social economic environment. Pregnant mothers and disadvantaged circumstances are at even higher risk. I would like to ask if the Government will consider a more concerted upstream support at maternal stage for women, including looking after both their social and healthcare needs. Secondly, would the Government consider piloting more care services for maternal and child health such as the new Temasek Foundation Integrated Maternal and Child Wellness Hub at SingHealth Polyclinic at Punggol, to better understand what kind of intervention can improve the outcomes of maternal and children health. Lastly, how can the Government enable evidence-based information to be disseminated more effectively to more pregnant women to increase awareness and encourage self-care for the well-being of their children?\"], ['The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong)', 'Mr Chairman, I would like to thank Members for their speeches and their remarks. Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about the COVID-19 situation. Let me provide a brief overview. Globally, the number of new cases and deaths continue to trend down, although there was a spike in the last week of February. So, we need to watch. Within Singapore, the COVID-19 situation has stabilised, with one or two new community cases on some days. Imported cases are isolated on arrival and the risk of transmission to the community is low. However, the World Health Organization has just warned that we need to stay vigilant as the pandemic is not likely to be over within this year. I want to thank everyone – Singaporeans, healthcare workers, businessmen, businesses, enterprises, Government agencies – for playing your part this past year. Your sacrifices have helped Singapore weather this storm. Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about the impact of COVID-19 on our infrastructure projects. As I have informed the House earlier, the pandemic has delayed many of our healthcare infrastructure projects by up to a year or so. Construction works have since been ramping up progressively and we are working on contingency measures to ensure we are able to meet the needs of our people. We are making steady progress in our vaccination programme. As of 4 March, more than 350,000 Singapore Residents have received their first dose, including some 80% of our healthcare workforce, and 215,000 have received their second doses. We have started with our seniors, too. I would like to thank our community volunteers from the People’s Association and Silver Generation Ambassadors who have worked hard in reaching out to our seniors and helping them to make their appointments. Over 40,000 seniors aged 70 and above have received their first dose. We will soon begin the vaccination of seniors aged 60 and above. Mr Chairman, allow me to say a few words in Mandarin please.'], ['The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong)', 'Seniors are most at risk of severe outcomes if they are infected with COVID-19. Therefore, we have prioritised seniors in our vaccination programme. The vaccines approved for use in Singapore must meet stringent safety and efficacy standards. I urge Singaporeans to get vaccinated. Some Singaporeans with chronic diseases are worried about being vaccinated. Do not worry, because we will arrange for healthcare professionals on site to assess if you can be vaccinated safely. In fact, most people can be vaccinated safely, including those with diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, asthma, chronic lung disease, heart disease and cancer patients in remission. Hence, I encourage Singaporeans with these conditions to register for vaccination as soon as they are invited.'], ['The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong)', 'Let me emphasise that only COVID-19 vaccines that meet strict standards of safety and effectiveness will be used in Singapore for our Singapore Residents. We will monitor the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and adjust our measures accordingly. We will also continue to strengthen our defences for future health system crises, such as Disease X. Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary will share more. Even as we mobilise the nation to fight COVID-19, we have to remain focused on long-term issues. Members may recall our Three Beyonds to meet our challenges in the future. Beyond Hospital to Community, to provide better care closer to home; Beyond Quality to Value, to help Singaporeans stretch their dollar; and Beyond Healthcare to Health, to help Singaporeans stay healthy. We will continue to anchor care in the community by strengthening primary care. We will be building 12 new polyclinics, bringing the total to 32 by 2030. The Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) has been expanded recently to allow more Singaporeans to receive subsidised care from private GPs, who are our key partners in primary care. We are also expanding community care, especially for our seniors. We have expanded the Community Nursing teams to cover 29 regions across Singapore since September 2020, with a total of 185 Community Nursing Posts to make care more accessible to our seniors. We will add new Community Nursing Posts where needed. Our second thrust is to stretch your health dollar. Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Leong Mun Wai asked about how we manage healthcare costs. We keep care affordable and sustainable through a multi-pronged approach. First, we leverage risk pooling. Insurance plays a useful role in helping us stretch our resources through pooling, so that those who are ill can tap into the pool to pay for the healthcare services they need. That is why we introduced MediShield Life. But insurance has an inherent risk of over-consumption. This is because of OPM syndrome. What is OPM? Other People\\'s Money. Because through insurance, we are pooling resources and we are tapping on other people’s money in the pool to pay for our healthcare services. So, we need safeguards to encourage prudence when deciding on healthcare services. Dr Tan Yia Swam asked about Integrated Shield Plans (IPs), and I agree with Dr Tan that we can all benefit from more information-sharing and a better understanding of insurance products. Towards this objective, MOH has facilitated several engagement sessions with insurance providers and professional bodies to foster a better understanding of the parties’ concerns. Dr Tan herself was present at these sessions and we benefited significantly from her contributions. We have resolved some issues – not all – but discussions are still on-going. An important progress we have achieved is the establishment of a multilateral platform comprising Life Insurance Association, Academy of Medicine, Singapore and the Singapore Medical Association. This platform will allow discussions to resolve issues of common concern. We are also setting up a claims management mechanism to facilitate resolution of claims-related matters. Our common objective is to ensure patient care is not compromised and allow patients adequate choice, while ensuring that fees and claims remain reasonable. I am confident that with this common understanding, we can find workable solutions that will benefit all parties, insurers, doctors, as well as patients. Ms Hazel Poa asked about whether IPs can be made fully portable. As IPs are commercial products, their features and pricing are ultimately determined by private insurers. But what is important is that all Singaporeans are covered under MediShield Life, regardless of their medical conditions. Second, we will continue to improve the healthcare system’s cost effectiveness and efficiency. As Minister Lawrence Wong mentioned, the Agency for Care Effectiveness has enabled us to save $300 million since 2016 and benefited over 375,000 patients. The Agency for Logistics Procurement and Supply, or ALPS for short, has also achieved cost savings of about $180 million in two years by driving economies of scale through group procurement. Even with our best efforts, we will still be spending more on healthcare over time, given an ageing population and increasing consumption of healthcare services. The Government continues to bear a significant and growing share of the National Health Expenditure, from 40% in 2013 to 46% in 2018. We want all Singaporeans to be healthy and have access to good and affordable care. We pay particular attention to lower income households, as Mr Leon Perera highlighted, and provide them with additional support to ensure healthcare, including preventive health, remains affordable and accessible to them, and they can improve their health outcomes. Health outcomes are influenced by multiple factors, including social, biological, cultural preferences and environmental factors, in addition to Social Economic Status, or SES. Local studies showed that adults with lower SES do have differences in chronic disease prevalence. We have been publishing health data regularly. More data has been collected in the last two years including breakdown by education level as a proxy for SES, and this data will be published later this year. We will continue to refine the data we publish. From local studies, we also know that adults with lower SES do have good access to care and are able to control their health conditions well. Again, using educational attainment as a proxy for SES, among persons diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension and high blood cholesterol, over 90% of those with below Secondary school education had visited their doctor for their condition at least once in the preceding year. Further, the proportions of those with acceptable control of their medical conditions are close to the national averages. Nonetheless, we must continue to support them to improve health outcomes and we will need to start from young, which I will talk about in a short while. Through enhancing our healthcare financing system over the years, we have kept healthcare affordable, especially for the lower income patients. In fact, the lowest income quintile’s share of total subsidies was 37% in 2018, the highest across all income quintiles. Our healthcare financing framework is a progressive one, overall. Further, the amount of subsidies received per household for the lowest income quintile has increased by over 70% from 2013 to 2018. Overall, government spending on healthcare has grown year after year and is likely to continue to increase. But as Dr Tan Yia Swam mentioned, and I quote, \"government subsidy is a finite thing\". That is why we have to be prudent in how we allocate limited resources, to ensure that the support we provide is more targeted to benefit those with greater need. This is our third effort – to better target subsidies, such that those with less will receive more, healthcare is kept affordable for all, and patients can be cared for at the most appropriate facilities. We have recently enhanced the subsidies for low-income patients at the public Specialist Outpatient Clinics or SOCs. We will further adjust subsidies at the SOCs by introducing two new tiers of 30% and 40% subsidy for higher income patients. This will enable more subsidies to be channelled to those in greater need. With more targeted subsidies at the SOCs, we can now allow private patients discharged from our acute hospitals to choose subsidised follow-up care at the SOCs. Currently, they are treated as private patients at the SOCs. Next, we will align the means-testing basis in the acute hospitals to per capita household income which is more reflective of patients’ means, similar to the basis used for most healthcare schemes, rather than rely on personal income of the patient today. Lastly, we will also enhance subsidies at community hospitals, to keep them more affordable and facilitate the flow of patients from acute hospitals. Taken together, these moves will ensure more targeted use of our healthcare resources, stretch our healthcare dollars, and encourage appropriate care. Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon will go into greater detail in his speech. In the longer term, the best way to manage healthcare costs is through our third thrust – staying healthy. We encourage all Singaporeans, young and old, to partner us on this journey: attend your recommended health screenings regularly, go for vaccination, and adopt healthy living habits. I encourage all to also continue the good fight to win our on-going War on Diabetes and keep chronic conditions at bay. Parliamentary Secretary Rahayu will share more on this, as well as our other health promotion efforts. Earlier I talked about the three key thrusts, better care, stretching your dollar, and staying healthy. These are not isolated initiatives. All our policy and measures work together to take care of the health of every Singaporean, starting from birth and throughout their life journey, keeping them as healthy as possible, for as long as possible. The best place to start is right at the beginning. Minister Masagos will share our thinking on improving Child and Maternal Health, how to better support our children and their families, and to bring agencies together to co-deliver services and solutions for better outcomes. Our care transformation journey will continue. As we plan for our future health system, we will study how we can develop a longitudinal system of care services and programmes, to journey with you and design programmes with a life-course approach, taking care of each Singaporean from birth and throughout their life. The National Healthcare Group has, in fact, developed a River of Life framework to test this approach. As staying well often involves not just health but also social and other factors, we will also explore how we can pull in resources across agencies and service providers to support your overall well-being. SingHealth, for example, has started trials to prescribe not just drugs but also social programmes, such as diet, exercise and social activities. Dr Tan Wu Meng will be happy to know that they too have care coordinators to help guide their senior patients. Finally, the built environment also plays a key role in nudging our choices. Therefore, the built environment should be designed to promote healthy living and digital tools can also be used. NUHS, the National University Health System, is working on this with the various agencies. We will share more on these efforts at a later stage. Anchoring all these transformation efforts are our healthcare staff who will continue to play a central role in our future health system, much like how they have been at the forefront line in our battle against COVID-19. We are blessed with a very dedicated, driven and professional team. They are our most precious resource, and we will continue to provide them with better progression, more training opportunities, and greater recognition of the work and risks they undertake. Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon will elaborate on this. To conclude, as Prime Minister Lee said, it has been a year of uncertainty, anxiety, and fear. Many of us would have emerged slightly different from how we first entered. A little more tired, more stretched, perhaps a little tougher and, I hope, a little wiser. Partner with us as we journey forward and as we transform our healthcare system to be future-ready. Let us work together and help all Singaporeans to stay healthy, and live well, every day of your life.'], ['Mr Yip Hon Weng', 'Chairman, permission to take my three cuts together.'], ['Mr Yip Hon Weng', \"Chairman, active ageing has always been an important part of successful ageing. In the past years, HPB introduced many community programmes to encourage seniors to participate in healthy activities like group exercises and to create an avenue for neighbours to socialise. All these have a positive impact on the resident's well-being. With the COVID-19, the good work has been disrupted. Seniors are advised to stay home to reduce their exposure to the virus, as they are vulnerable. But this has affected their physical and emotional well-being. Without the in-person group exercises and the opportunity to meet their friends, they have less motivation to exercise. The online programmes are useful. But they are simply not quite the same. Our Action Plans to encourage active ageing must evolve with the pandemic. What is the progress on these? How else can we meet the evolving needs of our future seniors? Last year, MOH announced various measures to better support seniors to age in place. What is the progress of these measures, especially on the Eldercare Centres? Future generations of seniors will have different lifestyle preferences and aspirations. How are we meeting the evolving needs of our seniors? What are the measures of success and timelines for the plans? Many seniors have benefited from the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF). But there is still some room for improvement. Will the Ministry review the policy of the once-in-a-lifetime eligibility? Some seniors may require a replacement device after their first device has worn out from many years of use. Another problem is that they cannot apply for aids under the same category. So, if one applies for a walking stick now and gets progressively weaker over time, he might need a quad stick or walking frame but he would not be eligible. While there are other schemes like the Assistive Technology Fund under SG Enable, the multiple schemes make things more complex than necessary for the elderly. The lack of support for the repair of devices is another handicap. Batteries in motorised wheelchairs running out is a common problem and sometimes, these devices are perfectly usable after replacement of parts and repairs. But SMF does not provide such support, so we have to tap on other schemes. SMF also only covers consumables for applications made through a healthcare service provider like a nursing home. If the senior is cared for at his own home, he is not eligible. This runs contrary to our policies of encouraging ageing in place. I would also like to suggest that SMF extends its coverage to elderly-friendly safety features in non-HDB estates, such as ramps and grab bars, especially for the lower value private units. I hope that the Ministry can better refine the SMF to help those in need. COVID-19 presents new challenges for care-givers. The temporary suspension of certain care-giving services as well as the suspension of house visits during the circuit breaker period meant that many care-givers were on their own. Some of them had to cope with heightened feelings of anxiety, loneliness and depression. And with foreign domestic help being more costly and hard to come by in the midst of the pandemic, it is timely to review the Caregiver Support Action Plan that was launched in 2019. How has the plan benefited care-givers since its launch? How can we better support care-givers, particular those who are looking after individuals with mental health conditions? Can the Ministry look into availing more flexible homecare services to meet care-givers' needs? There are many instances I can think of whereby care-givers need a break but they are unable to find a care institution to provide short-term care within a short notice. For example, Mrs Koh, a resident in Yio Chu Kang, is a care-giver to her husband who has advanced dementia. Her domestic helper is going back to her home country and there is a transition period while waiting for the new helper to arrive, given Stay-Home Notice (SHN) rules. As such, there needs to be more respite care options available to help care-givers. We need to give more care to our care-givers.\"], ['Ms Yeo Wan Ling', 'Mr Chairman, Sir, I declare that I am a director of a social enterprise that provides care-giving services. Care-giving is one of the most noble yet taxing responsibilities a person can take on. In fact, many Singaporeans are called upon to become care-givers at crucial stages of their lives when their careers are developing or at a very abrupt notice when illnesses strike or accidents occur. Be it senior loved ones, children, the infirmed or fragile, those called on to become care-givers are up to a hefty task, often having to do this on a very long-term basis and often at the expense of their careers, time with their family and, sometimes, their own mental health. During my Budget speech, I spoke about my frazzled resident who needs 45 minutes a week to restore and refresh her spirits. Many other family care-givers I speak with also tell me that while they have made adjustments to their lives in the long-term care of their loved ones – some have resigned from their jobs, others have taken on full work-from-home arrangements, some have hired foreign domestic workers (FDWs) – the problem comes with the availability and affordability of short-term respite care. Besides self-care, care-givers need short breaks from care-giving to run errands like going to the post office, picking up groceries, or even going for a much needed haircut. Respite care typically lasts between 45 minutes and about three hours. To help our family care-givers balance their care-giving duties with the other responsibilities they are carrying in life, support systems like short-term respite care must be made available; and this must be affordable and accessible at very short notice. The Caregiver Support Action Plan developed by MOH and partner agencies addresses many care-giving related issues. However, I think that there is room to develop more support for respite care options beyond centre-based and nursing home respite care. Could MOH consider expanding their support to care-givers who need home-based short-term respite care through financial support and the availing of local care-giving resources such as creating a repository of local micro-jobbers who have care-giving experience?'], ['Dr Wan Rizal', \"Mr Chairman, I was asked recently, why am I asking for a cut for MOH when they should be getting an increment for their outstanding work in this pandemic, on top of the good work that they have been doing all this while. So, a big thank you to the Minister, his team from MOH and, of course, our healthcare workers. Unfortunately, we have read reports of healthcare workers being abused physically and mentally while carrying out their duties. Their sacrifice and courage were met by behaviours unacceptable in any circumstances. When the pandemic started to unfold, we hear of healthcare workers being sprayed disinfectant by neighbours, denied boarding private vehicles and many other instances on social media. The number of abuse and harassment cases increased from 1,080 in 2018 to 1,300 last year. How does MOH plan to further protect our healthcare workers' physical and mental well-being, considering the injustices made against them? Abuse aside, we are also aware that our healthcare workers work long hours and have overnight schedules. We must provide them with the best work-life balance to maintain healthy, mental well-being. How does the Ministry plan to support our healthcare workers in this aspect?\"], ['Ms Mariam Jaafar', 'Mr Chairman, may I have permission to take both cuts together?'], ['Ms Mariam Jaafar', \"As the daughter of a former nurse, I literally applauded at my seat when the Deputy Prime Minister announced the increase in healthcare workers' salaries. It is long overdue. Besides being a welcomed signal of the increasing recognition of the need to recognise the value of healthcare workers and the work that they do, one hopes that this will go some way to addressing the shortage of nurses and other healthcare workers today as our population ages. I would like to know if the Government has any expectations or targets for how much we can close the gap in demand with this move to increase compensation and, if a gap yet remains, what more we can do to meet the demand for healthcare workers and where the biggest obstacles are – from the life cycle of recruitment, to advancement, to retention. On recruitment, I would like to ask about the adequacy of spaces in our nursing programmes in our tertiary institutions as well as any data on leakage of students in nursing programmes who do not go on to become nurses, and why? I would also like to know the success rate at hiring people from other backgrounds into nursing – we heard some of that, I think, earlier in the debate – as well as the success rate of getting back former nurses and other women returning to work after some time off. On advancement, I would like to know what is being done to enhance the career paths for healthcare workers. On retention, I would like to know the top reasons why healthcare workers quit and what is being done to address each of these drivers, including a review of shift structures – both working and off-work schedules because a lot of research shows that the impact of shifts is more about off-work schedules and not actually the working schedules – and the support resources available to nurses. My next cut. The COVID-19 pandemic showed the necessity of a whole system approach in addressing a national crisis. Many doctors and nurses in private practice stepped forward as volunteers and private hospitals took in recovering COVID-19 patients at subsidised rates to free up capacity in public facilities. Such partnerships between public and private facilities also exist outside of a crisis environment. I have had residents who are public patients telling me they were referred to Raffles Hospital for their x-rays and much to my relief at whether they were making the right decision, I learned that they were going to be offered a subsidised rate. As a result, they were able to get their x-rays done earlier than the queues at the public hospital would otherwise have allowed. Mr Chairman, the private hospital sector is an important part of the healthcare eco-system. As the pandemic plays out, we may see some shifts in demand, for example, with more private sector patients opting to public care if they lose their jobs and their insurance and, of course, if there are changes to their Integrated Shield Plan (IP). I would like to ask the Ministry if there is opportunity to optimise the current balance of healthcare in public versus private facilities and better leverage private sector partnerships to provide care for public sector patients, in particular, our subsidised patients, which of course would require the right incentives across the delivery chain. Similarly, our private general practitioners (GPs), who play a critical role in MOH's thrust to shift healthcare beyond hospital to community as part of the goal to provide accessible, affordable and best care for all, I am heartened that we continue to build primary care capacity and strengthen primary care networks, including for mental health. But, of course, it is not just about expanding capacity, alignment of interests, incentives and processes is also key. Having GPs and community nurses with special interests and training, giving GPs and nurses direct access to specialist advice and closer teaming and better communication with doctors, which I know some private doctors do really effectively over email and WhatsApp, giving GPs and nurses access to a broader range of diagnostic tests are proven levers to transfer care to the community and, at the same time, reducing overall demand through direct demand management at the GP level and continued education efforts to make informed patients.\"], ['Ms Mariam Jaafar', 'I would like to ask the Ministry what is being done to enable and empower our GPs and nurses to further deliver care in the community.'], ['The Second Minister for Health (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)', 'Mr Chairman, since Independence, Singapore has charted through several crises, adapted to the changing world while strengthening our social compact to keep our society strong. Many Members of this House have shared how COVID-19 has accelerated change and uncertainties. As we recover, we must continue to renew our social compact, enabling our people to be resilient in overcoming future challenges. Our healthcare system is a critical part of our social compact. We will continue to transform it to become a proactive and inclusive care system for all Singaporeans, enabling them to attain good health and live well. We will build resilience in every individual throughout life, designing our care system to address Singaporeans\\' health needs and risks across their life course. Today, I will highlight how we are doing this at two ends of the spectrum: first, starting well in life; and second, ageing well. For our young, we need to help them start well and achieve their fullest potential. International research shows that the early years of life are a critical window for development, with lasting impact on later life outcomes. This extends to even before the child is born, during the antenatal stage. Locally, the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes, or GUSTO, found evidence that a mother\\'s health can directly influence a child\\'s development, which Ms Ng Ling Ling spoke about. These findings underscore the importance of intervening early in life to prevent disadvantages from snowballing, and that parents play a key role to a child\\'s long-term development. Mr Leon Perera will be happy to know that it was to this end that the Government launched and is scaling up KidSTART to give children from low-income families a good start in life through upstream support. We equip KidSTART parents with skills and knowledge to support their child\\'s development and physical and socio-emotional well-being. At our hospitals, the National University Hospital started an intervention programme called Promoting Parental Emotional Health to Enhance Child Learning (ProPEL). It supports mothers and mothers-to-be from low-income families through pregnancy into motherhood to enhance the child\\'s development and learning. Ms Nurdiana joined the programme during the early stages of her pregnancy. She struggled with anxiety after being diagnosed with an auto-immune disease and had lost her job. The ProPEL team provided psychological interventions – helping her work through her fears and anxiety on health, pregnancy and motherhood. With the support, Ms Nurdiana developed skills to better manage her stress and anxiety. She is now more confident to start her journey as a mother. The National Healthcare Group is partnering with a few Primary schools on the Living Well@School pilot. It aims to build awareness and motivation in choosing healthier food options for the young. Children are coached on healthier eating choices, while parents and teachers are equipped with resources to scaffold the child’s journey to embrace healthy living. While we have made good strides in promoting the health and well-being of children and their families upstream, we will continue to invest even more, so that we can have a healthier next generation. We must do so in a coordinated manner, across social, health and education boundaries. Therefore, I am pleased to announce that MOH will develop a Child and Maternal Health and Well-being Strategy to provide comprehensive support to women and their children. We will drive the Strategy and Action Plan through an inter-agency taskforce, over a five-year period. Its scope will span from pre-conception to adolescents aged 18 years old – many critical developmental milestones occur then. These are part of our larger efforts to improve the population’s health by addressing individual health needs and modifiable risk factors beyond the healthcare domain. The Taskforce will focus on cross-cutting issues that require multiple agencies to collaborate and address decisively, to achieve a common goal of better health, social and education outcomes for our young. We will review our service delivery processes to integrate our services better, across the domains. Our plans will be anchored on what matters most to mothers and their children. Since early this year, the Taskforce has already started engaging various groups of parents and stakeholders, to better understand their challenges in fostering a healthy lifestyle in their children and in accessing services. We found their feedback very insightful and will continue to facilitate more conversations throughout the year. Next, on the second group – our seniors. While COVID-19 has posed many challenges, it also presents us with new opportunities to further transform our support for them. In this spirit, we have embarked on a refresh of the Action Plan for Successful Ageing. Since its launch in 2015, we have made significant progress on many fronts. We have raised the retirement age, provided seniors with opportunities to learn and volunteer, and rolled out the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation Packages. Nevertheless, our plans must continue to evolve to meet the needs and aspirations of current and future generations. Achieving these aspirations is only possible through a whole-of-society, citizen-centric effort that brings together everyone to “turn silver into gold”. In my previous job, I was turning \"waste into wealth\"; this time, I am trying to turn \"silver into gold\". I am glad to share with Mr Yip Hon Weng that we have started engagement sessions since last October to partner citizens on the Refreshed Action Plan. I encourage everyone to join this meaningful national SGTogether effort! Having participated in some sessions myself, I am deeply encouraged by the diverse discussions and participants’ aspirations to age well. Beyond this, Mr Tan Wu Meng and other Members have also asked about our on-going efforts to enhance support for seniors. I would like to share about three areas – first, our care landscape; second, care-giver support; and third, developing the community care sector. Our care landscape. In our care landscape, we launched the new Community Care Apartments in Bukit Batok last month – a novel public housing-cum-care concept. The flats integrate senior-friendly housing features with care services and community building through social interaction and communal spaces. When I visited the exhibition at HDB Hub, a senior told me that she had been long awaiting this! Others said they appreciated the communal spirit that it brings, greater assurance to age independently and the range of programmes to keep them active. The flats were over-subscribed, with more than four seniors applying for each flat. We will continue to work with MND on planning for additional sites. Last December, we announced a new Eldercare Centre service to serve all seniors nationwide. These centres would be key nodes in our social support and care landscape, and the first batch of centres will start from 1 May 2021. MOH will set aside about $180 million to complete the rollout of over 200 centres by 2024. Each will provide a common suite of “ABC” services – A for Active ageing programmes, B for Befriending, and C – connecting to Care services. Seniors can participate in wellness activities or have their queries about care services and support schemes answered. Befrienders will reach out to those with little support. To better reflect the new model, centres that provide the suite of “ABC” services will be named “Active Ageing Centres”. Today, some centres provide care services, such as day care and community rehabilitation. They will be called “Active Ageing Care Hubs” once they come on board to provide the new “ABC” services on top of their existing regular care services. Next, on care-givers – they play a key role in supporting seniors to age well in the community. To support them better, MOH launched the Caregiver Support Action Plan (CSAP) two years ago. In response to Ms Yeo Wan Ling and Mr Yip Hon Weng, I am pleased to share that MOH, AIC and various community partners have rolled out all the initiatives under the CSAP. I will share a couple of examples. First, we launched the Home Caregiving Grant two years ago, providing a cash grant to help with care-giving costs. More than 29,000 care-givers have since benefited. To Mr Yip Hon Weng\\'s query, we are also reviewing the Seniors’ Mobility and Enabling Fund to further defray costs of care-giving. Second, we set up touchpoints within the community to support seniors and their care-givers. For example, the Silver Generation Office refers frail and homebound seniors to the Medical Escort and Transport service to assist them in getting to their medical appointments. Third, we also have various care-giver respite services. We introduced the home-based respite care pilot in September 2019 for palliative cancer patients and expanded this in 2021 to all patients receiving home palliative care, regardless of diagnosis.  Fourth, we will be launching a new grant, a new grant call this year on the Caregiving Ecosystem, under the National Innovation Challenge on Active and Confident Ageing, to support research on innovative solutions to sustainable care-giving. Fifth, we have worked with community partners to set up four care-giver community outreach teams to better support care-givers at risk of burn-out or developing mental health needs. We will increase this to six teams by year-end. We have also established seven care-giver support networks in Dementia-Friendly Communities, enabling peer support among care-givers. In addition, we will pilot a structured support system for care-givers of loved ones first diagnosed with dementia. We will proactively support and equip these persons with dementia and their care-givers with information upon the first diagnosis. I will also share more on the support measures we have for care-givers of Persons with Disabilities in my MSF COS speech. Finally, developing our community care sector. To better serve seniors’ needs, we have expanded the capacity of community care services. Since 2015, we have added 4,600 day care places, as well as 3,100 home care places for home-bound seniors. We have also added 4,000 nursing home beds to cater to frail seniors with less family support. We share Mr Ang Wei Neng’s concern about the impact of COVID-19 on the construction of nursing homes. To mitigate this, we are working with providers to open up currently non-operational beds. AIC also helps seniors and care-givers with alternative care arrangements while awaiting nursing home placement, such as the Interim Caregiver Service for short-term home-based custodial care, and the Integrated Home and Day Care programme. Seniors or care-givers who need help can approach AIC for further assistance. Before I conclude, let me summarise my speech in Malay.'], ['The Second Minister for Health (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)', 'The healthcare system is critical in building a cohesive social support system. We will continue to transform it to provide proactive and inclusive healthcare for all Singaporeans. We will develop a Child and Maternal Health and Well-being Strategy over a five-year period. This plan will provide comprehensive support to mothers and their young children during the critical phases of life to produce better health, social and education developmental outcomes for future generations. For seniors, we will work with the agencies and individuals from various backgrounds to co-own and implement new initiatives through the revamped Action Plan for Successful Ageing.'], ['The Second Minister for Health (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)', \"Chairman, we are in good stead to address the future's challenges by identifying points of intervention upstream and strengthening support in the community. These are part of our continuous efforts to renew our social compact to safeguard our future as a strong, resilient and caring society.\"], ['The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Koh Poh Koon)', \"Mr Chairman, even as we continue the fight against COVID-19, MOH’s key priority continues to be a healthcare system that provides good quality, affordable and sustainable healthcare for all Singaporeans. I will speak on how deepening our partnerships with the private sector, strengthening our healthcare financing system, driving greater value in healthcare delivery, and uplifting our healthcare workforce can help us to achieve these aims. Our strong partnerships with the private sector over the years have allowed us to mount a robust and coordinated national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have partnered private hospitals to provide subsidised care to patients, such as Raffles Hospital for non-life-threatening emergency cases, an example referenced by Ms Mariam Jafaar, as well as Parkway Hospital, Mt Alvenia and Farrer Park Hospitals for other conditions, including dengue. At the peak of COVID-19, up to 400 beds across seven private hospitals were used to manage recovering COVID-19 patients. Private providers also supported our Community Care Facilities, clinics in worker dormitories, roving medical or swabbing teams, and many much more. Our partnerships with private GPs have also matured over the years. CHAS subsidies have expanded since 2012. Today, over two million Singaporeans can access subsidised primary care at CHAS GP clinics. In FY19 alone, we disbursed more than $180 million in CHAS subsidies. GP clinics in Primary Care Networks (PCNs) anchored care in the community, deriving economies of scale for ancillary services, and serving 130,000 patients with chronic conditions last year. Over 970 private GP clinics serve as Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), screening all patients with acute respiratory infections and conducted more than 250,000 swabs for early detection and containment of community COVID-19 cases. In the long-term care sector, private nursing homes receive funding to provide subsidised services. Both private and not-for-profit organisations also operate many Government-built nursing homes and eldercare centres, under a Build-Own-Lease arrangement. In the pandemic, they actively stepped up safe management measures and supported COVID-19 testing and vaccinations to keep our seniors safe. To mount a strong pandemic response, MOH also tapped on expertise and resources from private laboratories for PCR testing capacity, vendors and distributors of medical supplies, cleaning companies that disinfected our medical facilities, and security companies, facility managers and transport companies that supported our quarantine and other operations. There are too many to list comprehensively, but each one helped make our robust national response to COVID-19 possible. On behalf of all Singaporeans, I thank our many private-sector partners for protecting Singaporeans from the scourge of COVID-19. I, therefore, agree with Ms Mariam Jaafar that the Government should continue to renew and deepen our partnership with private healthcare providers. First, we will uplift capabilities of our GPs through continuing professional education. For example, the Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE)’s Clinical Update Service (CUES) assists GPs in navigating areas of uncertainty and challenges specific to their area of practice through personalised, evidence-based discussions. We will also train and equip GPs to care for persons with mental health needs. My colleague, Senior Minister of State Janil Puthucheary, will share more on this later. Second, strengthening regulatory frameworks, such as the Healthcare Services Act (HCSA) passed in January last year, will help us to better regulate newer, non-premises-based, models of care, such as telemedicine, through a services-based licensing framework. Fee benchmarks, an area which Dr Tan Yia Swam mentioned earlier, was introduced in 2018. This gave patients seeking care at private sector providers more confidence that charges are fair and reasonable. Early data showed that doctors have been taking reference from the benchmarks, with more than 80% of charges in 2019 within the upper limit of the benchmarks, and this is about 4% higher than in 2018. Therefore, together with the Fee Benchmarks Advisory Committee, we introduced new benchmarks for anaesthetist and inpatient attendance charges in December 2020 and will continue to review and develop new areas of fee benchmarking. I will now move on to our healthcare financing system which is anchored on Government subsidies and the 3Ms: MediShield Life, MediSave and MediFund. Today, the Government provides significant subsidies, covering up to 80% of treatment costs. In FY19, Government spending on healthcare subsidies amounted to approximately $5.7 billion, or about 60% of MOH's total operating budget that year. This is projected to grow to S$6.5 billion in FY20, an increase of 13.6%. As a society, we widely accept the need to be progressive and to target subsidies to those with greater needs. When formulating subsidy levels across the various healthcare settings, we should also encourage right-siting of care. We will, therefore, introduce a set of changes to the subsidy frameworks for inpatient care at the acute hospitals, specialist outpatient clinics (SOCs) and community hospitals. Let me go through each in turn. First, the acute hospitals. For inpatient admissions to acute hospitals, we currently use individual income as the basis for means-testing. I have seen in my clinical practice and also met people during my Meet-The-People sessions, how a sole breadwinner may earn a high individual income, but shoulders the full responsibility for his or her household needs alone. For such individuals, healthcare costs can become a significant strain, and I have great sympathy for them. Per Capita Household Income (PCHI), which is already widely used in our healthcare system, is, therefore, a better measure of means, as it also considers the amount of household support available, and the number of household members that this individual supports. MOH will thus align means-testing for inpatient admissions to acute hospitals from individual income to PCHI. Another observation over the years is that the physical differences between B2 and C wards are no longer so obvious, following infrastructural improvements to raise patient safety and infection control standards. However, we still have a legacy system of using choice of wards as a proxy of financial means to differentiate subsidy levels. Currently, B2 wards are subsidised at 50% to 65% and C-class wards at 65% to 80%. With better means-testing through PCHI, there is, therefore, less need to rely on ward choice. Therefore, we will unify B2 and C subsidies into a common framework, maintaining the same minimum and maximum range at 50% to 80%. This acute inpatient subsidy framework will also be applied to day surgeries which are currently subsidised at 65%. Effectively, this will increase subsidies for 70% of day surgery bills and encourage day surgeries instead of inpatient admissions when appropriate. Overall, with MediShield Life and MediSave, we expect that most patients will not see a change in out-of-pocket payments, or OOP payments, with about 30% seeing lower OOP and about 15% seeing higher OOP. Let me go to the SOC setting. While we raised SOC subsidies for the lower income up to 70% in 2014, higher income patients and median-income patients currently receive the same 50% subsidy support, despite both having quite different financial means. To bring about greater progressivity and allow resources to be better directed, MOH will introduce two new subsidy tiers in the SOC setting for patients with higher PCHI: (a) 40% for PCHI more than $3,300 and (b) 30% for PCHI more than $6,500. For a family of four, these PCHI levels correspond to household incomes of $13,200 and $26,000 respectively. Nonetheless, these higher income households may continue to tap on MediSave up to the applicable withdrawal limits to help pay for healthcare bills. With the introduction of the CHAS Green tier in 2019, higher PCHI patients with chronic conditions also have access to subsidised chronic care at CHAS GP clinics as an alternative. Complex chronic patients who are not suitable for management at primary care will also be able to utilise their MediSave through higher limits that are going to be introduced. I will speak more about this later. Sir, having been in clinical practice for more than 20 years, I have also seen subsidised patients in the surgical SOCs who have, at times, preferred an A or B1 ward for specific procedures. Some preferred air-conditioning and others wanted more privacy in the private wards. But the cost of a potentially long tail of SOC consultations upon discharge worries them. For this reason, some patients have sometimes had to forgo their preference and request for a subsidised ward instead. These particular groups are those that Dr Tan Yia Swam shared earlier. With better targeted subsidies at the SOCs, we will now allow private patients in the Inpatient setting to opt for either subsidised or private SOC for their discharge follow up. If subsidised SOC is chosen, the patient will no longer be able to pick their specialist, as is the current practice. Overall, the SOC subsidy changes will affect about 30% of subsidised SOC patients, who are from higher PCHI households. Of these, seven in 10 will see an increase of less than $100 in total co-payment for their cumulative annual bills. This can be further offset by MediSave or MediShield Life, or for those who have private insurance coverage. For elderly patients, any increase in co-payment will also be partially offset by Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation subsidies. This brings me to community hospitals (CHs). Having worked in an acute surgical ward, I have occasionally encountered patients who have recovered significantly to be well enough for discharge to a community hospital for sub-acute or rehabilitative care, but who were reluctant to do so, due to the differences in the subsidy levels between acute and community hospitals. We will, therefore, enhance subsidies available in our community hospitals to support patients in utilising appropriate care, and facilitate the smooth flow of patients from acute hospitals to community hospitals. This allows acute hospital resources to be available for patients who require more intensive acute care. We will raise the maximum subsidy of community hospitals to 80%, aligned with that of acute inpatient care, and further increase the minimum subsidy from 20% to 30%. Together with increased MediShield Life claim limits for community hospitals sub-acute care from 1 March 2021, this should make community hospitals even more affordable, especially when compared to a prolonged acute hospital stay. Almost all, about 95% of all community hospitals patients will see an increase in subsidies. Mr Chairman, subsidies are the bedrock of our healthcare financing system. Healthcare costs will continue to rise in the years ahead, and Government spending on healthcare subsidies will commensurately increase even after all these changes. The changes outlined will make healthcare subsidies more progressive and help facilitate care at appropriate settings. We expect to implement these changes over the course of 2022. In addition to these changes, MOH will also review the financing landscape in the Long-Term Care, or LTC, sector. Last year, we launched CareShield Life and Medisave Care, improving affordability. However, as we uplift standards and draw in more Singaporeans to work in the LTC sector, cost pressures may potentially impact affordability. So, in anticipation of these challenges, we will once again review the financing situation for the LTC sector to see if further changes are needed. Next, I will speak on the enhancements to MediShield Life and MediSave. First, MediShield Life covers Singaporeans for large hospitalisation bills and selected costly outpatient treatments. Following the recent MediShield Life 2020 review, various benefit changes have been made to ensure that the scheme continues to provide adequate and meaningful protection to Singaporeans. These include raising the policy year claim limit from $100,000 to $150,000. Premiums will also be adjusted to keep the scheme solvent and sustainable. The Government will provide up to $2.2 billion in premium subsidies and support over the next three years. Net premium increases for all Singapore citizens will be kept to no more than about 10% in the first year. Premium payment will also be deferred till the end 2021 for those who have insufficient MediSave balances and are unable to pay their premiums due to the economic impact from COVID-19. As noted by Mr Gerald Giam, the benefit changes and premium adjustments will take effect on or after 1 March 2021, which is the Monday that just passed. On premium pricing, I wish to assure Mr Gerald Giam that the pricing assumptions are assessed by independent actuarial experts. We are studying how technically complex actuarial reports can be shared in a meaningful way, and will provide an update when ready. Second, MediSave helps Singaporeans set aside some income towards their future healthcare needs, such as co-payments for large bills and for health insurance premiums. I would like to assure Dr Lim Wee Kiak that the MediSave contribution rates and Basic Healthcare Sum are reviewed regularly, in conjunction with other key healthcare financing levers, such as Government subsidies and MediShield Life. Ms Hazel Poa and Mr Gerald Giam asked how MediSave coverage can be expanded in the outpatient setting. We certainly recognise that seniors tend to have higher healthcare expenses, especially if they have chronic conditions. From the start of this year, we raised annual MediSave limits from $500 to $700 for patients with complex chronic conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme, or CDMP. The list of CDMP conditions will be reviewed regularly. To support elderly patients in seeking outpatient treatment, we also introduced Flexi-MediSave in 2015, and lowered the age eligibility from 65 to 60 in 2018, allowing more patients to benefit. From 1 June 2021, we will further raise the Flexi-MediSave annual limit from $200 to $300. We will continue to review the MediSave withdrawal limits regularly, to ensure that they remain relevant and adequate for Singaporeans. Beyond healthcare financing, as Dr Lim Wee Kiak has pointed out, we must also control upstream growth in medical costs to ensure affordability in the long run. First, we should tap on technology to deliver care more effectively while optimising our limited manpower resource. Since the circuit breaker period, polyclinics, SOCs and community nursing teams have used teleconsultation to reach their patients at home, allowing continued consultation and advice for these patients during the circuit breaker period. I understand from feedback that patients are comfortable with teleconsultation. Further, when ready, the National Central Fill Pharmacy will consolidate medications across multiple providers in a central location, enabling the delivery of medications directly to patient's homes, secured post boxes or other convenient locations. This will improve the access to pharmacy services, including for seniors with mobility needs, as Dr Tan Wu Meng mentioned, and support new care models, such as telemedicine. We also agree with Dr Tan Wu Meng that patient navigators can improve patient convenience, and our public healthcare institutions have increased the number of staff trained in such roles by 3% annually between 2018 and 2020. But beyond this, we have also improved scheduling services and offer telehealth follow-ups for suitable patients, helping to reduce the need for multiple hospital visits. Second, innovative care models have been introduced to improve right-siting of care in the community. Examples include the Urgent Care Centre (UCC) pilot concept and the GPFirst Pilot Programme which support patients with non-emergency conditions, helping them avoid unnecessary emergency department visits. MOH will review the performance of such technology-enabled services and innovative care models, and explore how we can scale up the promising ones. We also strive for greater value and better services in our healthcare system. The Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE) helps us to ensure that the prices we pay for subsidised treatments and vaccines are fair and commensurate with the healthcare outcomes they confer. This is done through health technology assessments and value-based pricing (VBP) negotiations. ACE will continue to ensure that subsidised medicines and medical technologies are both clinically and cost-effective. We also established ALPS in 2018 to aggregate demand and achieve economies of scale in procurement and supply chain management. In 2019, ALPS’s Central Warehouse Distribution (CWD) pilot for polyclinics saved an estimated $1.7 million through advanced warehouse and logistics technology. ALPS will study how this CWD concept can be expanded to the whole of public healthcare boosting efficiency, resilience, and value in our healthcare supply chain. We also agree with Ms Ng Ling Ling that funding mechanisms can drive greater value through influencing providers’ behaviour. We, in fact, implemented some of the ideas that she has shared. One financing innovation which MOH has started to adopt is bundled payments, where funding is based on a patient’s entire care episode, even across multiple healthcare settings or attendances. This gives providers the opportunity to optimise care, reduce costs, and pass on savings to patients. MOH has also implemented a Pay For Performance (P4P) framework which financially incentivises clusters to perform well in key priority areas and the Value-Driven Care (VDC) Programme which tracks clinical performance and cost of care for medical conditions. We will expand these positive efforts and study other financing solutions and innovations that encourage healthcare providers to optimise care and improve outcomes. Beyond technology and care models, healthcare is ultimately a high touch and people-centric sector. Healthcare professionals are key in improving patient care and outcomes. COVID-19 has shown us the importance of maintaining a resilient core of healthcare workers. Following the launch of the SG Healthcare Corps (SHC) in April last year, over 5,000 workers and volunteers have been trained, and provided support in areas such as the care of elderly in nursing homes, swab operations, laboratory testing and vaccination operations. Going forward, we plan to develop the Corps into a platform for citizen engagement and volunteerism in healthcare during peacetime, and serve as a reserve pool in times of crisis. COVID-19 has been a trying time for all our healthcare staff and volunteers. I know many staff in our public healthcare institutions suspended their annual leave to meet the surge in manpower demands during the height of the COVID-19 crisis. Many have played a critical role in the battle against COVID-19 and I would like to express our heartfelt thanks to all of them for their dedication and contributions, and their families for supporting them through this very tough period. We also recognise and appreciate the contributions of our outsourced workers in the healthcare sector. We agree with Dr Tan Wu Meng that their work is intrinsic to the hospital as many of them, such as cleaners and health attendants, work alongside our healthcare staff in the wards. The intent of outsourcing is to leverage economies of scale and enable our public healthcare institutions to focus on the core mission of delivery of healthcare services. While our public healthcare institutions are not their direct employers, they have also extended support and tokens of appreciation to these outsourced workers. We will continue to work closely with the outsourced companies to improve the work conditions of their staff. To strengthen our healthcare workforce, I agree with Ms Mariam Jaafar that we need to attract more talent to healthcare and to build a strong local core. First, we have strengthened our pipeline of fresh graduates. Since 2012, we have increased intakes and retained a strong local core of doctors, dentists, pharmacists and therapists. We have also strengthened the attractiveness of nursing, increasing intakes by about 45%, from about 1,500 in 2014 to about 2,200 in 2020. At steady state, we will be training about 3,300 students annually in our Institutes of Higher Learning to become healthcare professionals. Second, we have built pathways for progression, and continue to expand mid-career conversion pipelines. We introduced new pathways for Enrolled Nurses to move from Nitec to Diploma-level qualifications within a shorter time and progress as a Registered Nurse. In line with the recommendations of the Future Nursing Career Review Committee (FNCRC), we enhanced nursing career tracks and job scopes. Nurses can now perform a wider breadth of care tasks and make clinical decisions. We are seeing increased interest in our Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs). Between 2018 and 2020, an average of 160 mid-career locals enrolled each year, about double our average annual PCP intake in the preceding three years. This year, Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) will join Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) in offering the two-year accelerated PCP for diploma-level registered nurses. We will also explore more pathways for mid-career entrants to complete their training in a shorter time. The Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) is introducing an accelerated PCP in Occupational Therapy for those who have already got a degree in a science-related field. They can complete their training in slightly under three years instead of four years. Third, we actively partner healthcare employers in re-designing jobs for staff working in healthcare support and operations support roles. For example, the Care Support Associate (CSA) role in SGH, and AIC’s sectoral job redesign project relook processes and blend clinical support, administrative and operations responsibilities into new roles. These initiatives encourage cross-deployment and multi-skilling of staff, create new career pathways, and provide interesting development opportunities for them. Finally, we are cognisant that salaries play a key role in the attraction and retention of staff. Our healthcare workforce is the lifeblood of our healthcare system and the work that they do is critical in protecting the health and safety of our society. We must maintain the salary competitiveness of healthcare staff against the overall market to attract and retain quality talent. For doctors and dentists, we recently updated the salaries for junior House Officers, Medical and Dental Officers, Consultant Family Physicians and newly-promoted Associate Consultants within our public healthcare institutions in 2019. So, I am pleased to announce that nurses in the public healthcare sector can look forward to an increase of 5 to 14% in their monthly base salaries, phased over the next two years. Allied health professionals, pharmacists, and administrative and ancillary staff, including support care staff, in the public healthcare sector can also look forward to an increase of 3% to 7% in their monthly base salaries this year. We will also increase funding support to publicly-funded community care organisations to ensure that salaries of their staff also remain competitive. The changes to both sectors will be implemented from July this year. MOH will regularly monitor the salary competitiveness of our public healthcare workforce. Aside from salaries, we will also work with healthcare providers and union partners to make healthcare a progressive and fulfilling career. Sir, COVID-19 has posed a major challenge to our healthcare system, but we have learned valuable lessons and we will emerge stronger. With deeper partnerships with our private sector providers, innovative, value-based healthcare delivery, a strong healthcare financing framework, and a resilient healthcare workforce, we will be better placed to provide all Singaporeans with good quality, affordable, and accessible healthcare.\"], ['Dr Wan Rizal', 'Chairman, in my recent speeches, I spoke about the importance of mental health and the need to destigmatise mental health issues. Now, its frequency has reached to a point where my students have given me hashtag DWR4MH, which means \"Do what\\'s right for mental health.\" Chairman, we need to change the negative perception and treat mental health issues like any other health conditions. Additionally, it is crucial for those who need assistance are able to get them quickly and properly. Some time ago, I was approached by a family who has a teenage son who was depressed and suicidal. They did not seek professional help and I quote them, \"malu\" which means \"embarrassing\". \"The incident was indeed embarrassing and brought shame to the family.\" And when they were convinced to seek help finally, they found it daunting to go to the polyclinics, let alone IMH. The longer we delay the assistance rendered, the shorter the window period to undo this damage. We need a more comprehensive framework to address the issues of stigmatisation and, of course, accessibility. Last year, the Ministry announced that it would be expanding mental health services under the Community Mental Health Masterplan to enhance the reach and provide support for youths and their families. May the Minister, please, provide an update on this?'], ['Dr Tan Yia Swam', 'Yes, Sir. Mr Chairman, Sir, the COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce convened by the MOH and the IMH in October 2020, with representatives from various Ministries has done great work in promoting mental health literacy. Yet, I hear of anecdotal cases of discrimination against people who have mental illnesses. I will speak on three main groups: one, the general population and working adults; two, the young; three, other vulnerable groups. For the general public, how do we react when we see someone behaving “oddly” – such as talking to themselves, removing all their clothing in public, becoming violent for no apparent reason, or wailing inconsolably? Do we take a video and post the incident online? Call the Police? Walk away? Or will we step forward to offer some kind of help? I suspect many people want to, but we do not feel able to. For working adults, I understand when colleagues and bosses see only the underperformance of the affected employee. For example, frequent absenteeism, missing work deadlines, or simply being very unsociable at work. Physical illnesses such as high blood pressure and diabetes, have a measurable scale of normality. Mental illnesses are harder to pick up. Is someone just having a bad day? Is it triggered by something specific and situational which will resolve itself after the event is over? Or could these bad moods be symptoms of a mental illness such as depression, anxiety disorder or even schizophrenia? We need to have more schemes in place for the general population to recognise early signs of mental illnesses and learn how to assist as a first responder. Regarding the youth, the world is changing fast. I am only a few years past the official definition of \"youth\", but there are times when I feel very distant from them! Exploring one’s sense of identity as a growing teenager has never been easy. Being in a more connected world now, they are perhaps subject to more pressures. As a doctor, I have received ground feedback that there is a mental health crisis in our youths – child psychiatrists observe that youth suicide is at its highest rate in the past couple of years. Contributing factors may be increased parental conflicts and divorces, academic stresses, COVID-19, social media and bullying. How do we recognise and stop bullying of any kind – physical, emotional, verbal? In my Budget speech, I brought up the modern phenomenon of cyberbullying and the amplification effect of social media. A short video clip gets shared, liked and goes viral. Shaming gets weaponised. When I was a child, any once-off silly act gets forgotten, and maybe brought up only at annual family gatherings during Chinese New Year. But now, the Internet never forgets. Suicide is a painful and difficult subject, as there is a taboo around this. But this is exactly why healthcare has to educate and teach about the mental health issues that contribute to this tragedy. Let us guide our people to be more caring, and inclusive. How do we approach those who are different? Mental resilience, sleep hygiene, and the safe use of the Internet should be taught in schools, and to adults as well; to be given as much importance as physical exercise! I thank other Members, as well as MOE for addressing this, and welcome the changes to CCE. However, after we succeed in early detection, are there enough healthcare providers to render help? We will need enough psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, pharmacists, medical social workers, case managers, family therapists and so on. For many of the patients with mental illnesses, it is a lifelong disease, and some of the triggers may be related to socio-economic stressors. Young patients with mental health may just be the tip of the iceberg, and further investigation may uncover more members of the family with mental health issues. They will all need to have adequate treatment. Community support has to come in hand in hand with doctors in the hospital to provide integrated care. The network of support is essential to minimise the episodes and severity of relapses. Focus cannot be just on the acute admissions, but in discharge back to the community, gainful employment and meaningful living. Finally, vulnerable groups such as singles, single families and elderly staying alone may be at higher risk due to social isolation and lack of access to resources. Does the Ministry have plans in place to help these groups? In summary, the global COVID-19 pandemic has caused increased stress in multiple areas – retrenchment, change in jobs, lifestyles, education. This has a far-reaching impact on interpersonal relationships, physical and mental health. I urge MOH to further develop programmes on mental wellness and building resilience as a routine part of daily life. Many people are now working from home due to COVID-19. Other speakers have shared on the challenges that parents with young children face working from home. While some adults have managed to incorporate daily exercise into their new routine, many others are struggling to balance work, daily chores and the demands of family care. For many busy working parents, the daily commute to work and back home might be the only exercise they get. For example, walking 10 minutes to the MRT station and another 10 minutes to the workplace. This makes up a total of 40 minutes\\' walking time and one may clock 8,000 to 10,000 steps, hopefully. The lack of commute while working from home means a reduction in mobility. Some of us snack more. For those of us who like to chat over coffee or lunch at the office, working from home also results in less social engagement, which may lead to chronic health issues such as obesity, depression and anxiety. What are the Ministry\\'s plans to support Singaporeans to pursue healthy habits in this new norm?'], ['Dr Lim Wee Kiak', 'Mr Chairman, nowadays, we see everyone wearing a healthcare device to monitor our steps, our heartrate, our stress level, oxygen saturation and how well we slept last night. Some of the more advanced ones perform electrocardiogram (ECG) and even measure your blood sugar levels now as well as blood pressure. On our home front, I am encouraged to read about the Health Promotion Board and Fitbit – headquartered in San Francisco, California – tap on technology to help Singaporeans to live healthier using its devices. I must commend the Ministry for mobilising technology to boost Singaporeans\\' interest in fitness and healthcare. Sir, I think Singaporeans are ready to use digital technology to take charge and take responsibility of their own health. Let Singaporeans have accessibility to their own health data when the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) is ready. I envisage in the near future, I will have access to my own medical as well as health record, just like the details of my COVID-19 vaccinations on HealthHub app now. In the near future, I will receive a reminder from MOH for my annual health checks, blood tests, annual immunisation, and my once-in-five-years colonoscopy screening. Once completed, there could be an artificial intelligence (AI) system in MOH that will review my health records, and then they will send me an advice to take active steps to improve my health through lifestyle adjustments. They may recalculate and lower my annual MediShield insurance premium, if my health is good. That will encourage more Singaporeans to come on board and to take responsibility of their own health. I feel we can go a step further now to get Singaporeans to do more exercises, to manage their stress, maintain mental wellbeing and manage their sleep better. Another area would be to manage good nutritional diet daily and influence them to have good eating habits. Singaporeans already have one of the longest lifespans in the world but we spend the last decade of our lives in poor health. What we want is not just a long lifespan but a healthier lifespan. I urge MOH to take advantage of all the advances in digital healthcare devices now to set up a national health management system and to step up the partnership with Singaporeans to achieve good health for life. Sir, the popular adage goes, \"prevention is better than cure\", and in modern healthcare, immunisation against infectious diseases and potentially fatal diseases is the key factor to a long, healthy lifespan. One of the things that comes out from this COVID-19 pandemic is the heightened public awareness about the role of immunisation in our healthcare measures. Immunisation is one of the key advances in medicine that has extended the lifespan of humans globally. Apart from the immunisations that we received during our childhood, many Singaporeans do not get regular immunisations unless they need to travel or for work. How many Singaporeans would regularly go for their annual flu vaccinations or pneumococcal vaccinations? Even new vaccines such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine will reduce the risk of cervical cancer. Although we have a comprehensive vaccination programme for our children, do we have a more comprehensive programme for adults and the elderly? We are constantly reminded to take our COVID-19 vaccination to protect our loved ones, especially those immuno-compromised and the elderly around us. Likewise, we should do the same for influenza. Perhaps not immediately but in the months ahead as we advance in our COVID-19 vaccination, I would urge MOH to take advantage of this opportune time to review and enhance our national immunisation programme, implement measures to promote public awareness and facilitate and improve accessibility and affordability of immunisation for all Singaporeans for their good health.'], ['The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Janil Puthucheary)', 'Mr Chairman, Singapore is fortunate to have a workforce in the healthcare family driven by professionalism and dedication. Our people answered the call of duty, they have carried us far in this fight against COVID-19 and have contributed to keeping Singapore safe during the pandemic. Our infectious diseases experts and staff at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and other public healthcare institutions have worked to provide clinical guidance to and support for public health operations. Laboratory specialists at the National Public Health Laboratory provided guidance for COVID-19 tests and conducted genomic analysis to support cluster investigations and surveillance for variants. The staff at the public and private healthcare institutions do their duty, putting themselves in harm\\'s way. They undertake healthcare operations in high-risk locations like the foreign workers\\' dormitories, emergency departments, hospital wards and intensive care units across our healthcare system. I echo the sentiments of many in the House to express our deep appreciation for colleagues in many, many different roles. The work continues and Members will know that we started our national vaccination operations at NCID on 30 December 2020. NCID was one of several initiatives and projects that came out of the lessons we learned from SARS. In the test of that crisis, we identified vulnerabilities and in our response, developed capabilities and institutions that exist to this day, like NCID, helping us with COVID-19. In this crisis, we are learning new lessons and responding to different vulnerabilities. We need to institutionalise the capabilities that we are developing. We have needed to deal with the pandemic and continue the usual clinical services and, now, stand up a massive national vaccination exercise. Many of these skills, tools, processes and systems we have developed are distributed across our healthcare network and the care providers. But centrally, at MOH, we have had to also develop and improve our organisational capability to manage the response to this crisis and, hopefully, be better prepared for the next. At MOH, we have set up a new Crisis Strategy and Operations Group. They have worked hard, in collaboration with other Ministries and other agencies, to coordinate COVID-19-related operations. This is a capability and a team that we will need in order to be better prepared for the next pandemic. We are heartened by the appreciation demonstrated by the public for our healthcare workers. However, today, there are still cases of harassment and abuse against staff. This has affected their well-being and their safety. To Dr Wan Rizal\\'s question, we take abuse and harassment against our healthcare workers very seriously and will not hesitate to take appropriate action when necessary. The enhancements to the Protection from Harassment Act in November 2014 gave additional protection against harassment to Public sector healthcare professionals and support care staff. Public healthcare institutions also have policies in place to handle abuse cases. The institutions conduct training for healthcare staff, including on de-escalation measures during potential conflict and abuse. In addition, we will work with the clusters and the Healthcare Services Employees\\' Union (HSEU) on a tripartite effort to strengthen messages against abuse and harassment of public healthcare staff. During the Budget debate, Mr Darryl David asked about staff benefits. Dr Wan Rizal also asked about this just recently. Our public healthcare institutions do pay close attention to staff leave and make time for sufficient rest. These are planned to ensure sufficient staffing for patient safety. There are also rostered breaks and staff rotations to ensure sufficient rest during and between shifts. To better support our healthcare staff, a cross-cluster Staff Wellbeing Committee, with representatives from our public healthcare institutions and MOH, has been set up. The committee will share best practices and provide feedback to MOH on possible enhancements to improve staff wellbeing. Besides healthcare workers, our HealthTech – health technology – engineers have also played an important role. They have rapidly developed systems to support new operational demands, including the on-going vaccination operations. These are also important capabilities that we need within our system. Thus, to grow our health technology workforce, we work closely with the Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) to redesign jobs and actively recruit people into new roles, including software engineers, systems analysts and cybersecurity professionals. To facilitate mid-career switches into HealthTech, IHiS, Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and SkillsFuture have curated specific training programmes. One such example of a mid-career switch is a gentleman by the name of Mr Daniel Ong, whom I spoke to recently. He was a copywriter and his formal education was in English Literature. He could not write code before joining IMDA\\'s Tech Immersion and Placement Programme, which is part of our TechSkills Accelerator. In March last year, Daniel began work at IHiS as a front-end developer. He has contributed to two IT projects supporting the fight against COVID-19. Now, he is developing the user-facing components of the system supporting the One-Rehab framework, which I will speak a little bit more about later. We hope that more people will see opportunities in this HealthTech space and embrace the possibility that with some training, they can join the healthcare family, not necessarily as a clinician but contributing to the success of our public healthcare eco-system. As Mr Ang Wei Neng pointed out, we can and should learn many things from our fight against COVID-19. For example, our early, comprehensive and persistent contact tracing and quarantine efforts have played a key role in our COVID-19 response. Besides the vigilance and skill of our healthcare workforce, our digital tools such as SafeEntry and TraceTogether continue to be central to the speed and efficiency of our contact tracing. Coupled with our aggressive testing strategies, these measures have contributed to our success in keeping the number of our community cases under control, for now. To swiftly identify COVID-19 cases and contain the outbreak, we have built up our testing capacity and our community testing operations. Through targeted operations as well as routine surveillance testing, such as the testing of our hawker centre workers, we have so far been able to detect cases and quickly prevent spread. As a repository of patient records, the National Electronic Health Records (NEHR) has also been a key enabler in facilitating this provision of care during the pandemic. Healthcare professionals can access NEHR for their patients\\' COVID-19 test results and their existing medical conditions before the vaccination. The NEHR has also been enhanced this year to meet the requirements for COVID-19 vaccinations, displaying alerts and reporting problems. As we do this, data security remains a key priority. We have been taking steps to improve the security of our NEHR through technical and process enhancements, in response to the security reviews that we conducted in 2018. We expect to complete most of this within the year and onboard more healthcare institutions to contribute to NEHR more securely. Beyond COVID-19, we must be ready to respond to future public health crises by having the right systems and capabilities. We will do so in four ways. First, we will enhance our surveillance and response capabilities through the use of new technologies to enable us to more effectively consolidate, analyse and generate insights from large amounts of data. Second, we will augment our human capabilities to prepare Singapore against future threats. Skilled clinical teams will always play an important role in detecting and managing new diseases and outbreaks, and we also need other experts such as epidemiologists, data scientists, statisticians and software engineers like Daniel. We need teams to investigate and perform advance analytics, for example, to determine the likelihood of spread and inform our response to an outbreak. Third, while we remain in DORSCON Orange for now – DORSCON stands for Disease Outbreak Response System Condition – we will look into strengthening our DORSCON framework, incorporating lessons learnt from the pandemic so that we can better communicate public health risk and to help us more effectively respond as a whole society when \"Disease X\" strikes, the next serious pandemic crisis. Finally, we will develop a national R&D Programme for Research in Epidemic Preparedness And Response – and the acronym is appropriately called PREPARE to strengthen our R&D capabilities to prevent, prepare for and respond to future public health crises. It will include (a) strengthening infectious disease collaboration networks locally and regionally; (b) strengthening capabilities for the accelerated development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; and (c) establishing a national infectious disease repository and database for research and data analysis. To further address Mr Ang’s question, MOH regularly reviews our national response and is conducting an interim review. It will include other Ministries and Agencies. We will share details when completed. Beyond pandemics, we must ensure that the healthcare needs of our general population are met. The work continues. Our polyclinics are a vital element in our Public Health primary response. Built in 1980, Clementi Polyclinic is one of our oldest and smaller polyclinics. Its central location has served residents well, with about 850 patients seen per day. We will be redeveloping the polyclinic by 2027 to better serve residents in the region. Dr Tan Wu Meng asked whether we have considered patient’s comfort and staff’s performance in our design of healthcare facilities. The answer is yes. When designing new healthcare facilities, the design team will engage stakeholders including the care team, patients and carers, and the facilities management team. The redeveloped Clementi Polyclinic will undergo the same process. It will be more spacious with more elderly-friendly and accessibility features. Residents can also look forward to a comprehensive range of primary care services, including medical treatment for acute conditions, chronic disease management, women’s and children’s health services, as well as radiological, laboratory and pharmacy services. Another example of the on-going work to improve routine clinical care services despite the pandemic is to ensure our population has timely access to the right level of rehabilitation care. We have developed the National One-Rehab framework. Under this framework, patients will have improved access to community-based rehabilitation and benefit from expanded capacity and capability in the care providers. Our hospitals, polyclinics and community care providers will embark on a multi-year pilot to validate this new care model. Our hope for patients with stable musculoskeletal conditions such as lower back pain who do not require surgery or complex interventions to receive this rehabilitation care in the community, instead of only at specialist clinics or hospitals. During last week’s Budget debate, we heard Dr Shahira Abdullah, Ms Carrie Tan, Dr Wan Rizal, Ms Mariam Jaafar and Mr Eric Chua speak about mental health. Since the launch of the Community Mental Health Masterplan in 2012, and its enhancement in 2017, we have increased the capacity of community mental health services. We are on track to meeting our targets by end 2021. In primary care, we have over 220 GP partners and 14 polyclinics providing mental health and/or dementia services. We have set up 50 community outreach teams and reached out to over 350,000 persons with mental health or dementia needs. In addition, 21 community intervention teams were established to provide mental health interventions such as psycho-social therapeutic interventions and counselling. We have met our targets of 50 community outreach teams and 18 community intervention teams ahead of our end 2021 timeline. To Dr Wan Rizal’s question on support for youth and their families, we have piloted the Integrated Youth Service (IYS) within the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and Care Corner, which is one of our community partners in the North. Since April 2020, Care Corner has begun community outreach using online platforms, and has reached out to over 2,600 users. In November 2020, the Care Corner team moved into the new Woods Square Community Space, to provide face-to-face mental health screening and basic emotional support sessions for persons with mental health challenges, and to conduct experiential resilience or mental well-being events. MOH and AIC have also worked with other community partners to set up youth community outreach teams to reach out to young people in mental distress to provide basic emotional support and resources. The team would also engage the family to understand the stressors and the home environment. Links to social and health services would also be provided. Through the Youth Mental Well-being Network, we have heard from the youth, mental health and social sector professionals, patients and caregivers, on how we could improve the mental well-being of our young people. Minister of State Sun Xueling earlier shared on how the Network has initiated ideas for over 30 potential ground-up projects. Parliamentary Secretary Eric Chua will also be sharing about an initiative to provide positive peer support during his MSF speech. The three of us are working together, just as MOE, MSF and MSH are working together on this important area. To look into the psycho-social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the population, we set up the COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce in October 2020. The Taskforce has reviewed and recommended three areas to work on, namely, to develop a national mental health and well-being strategy; secondly, a national mental health resources webpage; and a national mental health competency training framework. Beyond COVID-19, we will evolve the Taskforce into an inter-agency platform on mental health and well-being, by mid 2021. The platform will oversee mental health and well-being efforts, focusing on cross-cutting issues that require multi- and inter-agency collaborations. We are working out the details of the platform and will share more when ready. Dr Tan Yia Swam asked about the support for other vulnerable groups such as our seniors and building a more inclusive society. The Government recognises that those who suffer from mental health conditions may face discrimination. We have been working with partners to roll out initiatives to address this issue. It will take a whole-of-society approach to tackle this issue effectively. The National Council of Social Service launched the “Beyond the Label” movement in 2018 to fight the stigma of mental health conditions and encourage social inclusion, positive attitudes and support towards persons living with mental health conditions. The movement also provides a platform for more conversations about mental health and promotes greater awareness and the acceptance of mental health conditions among the public. To reach out to persons with or at-risk of mental health conditions or dementia, including seniors, community teams also reach out to residents and their caregivers to provide mental health or dementia information, basic emotional support and links to appropriate services, health or social, as necessary. For seniors at risk of social isolation, the AACs, Silver Generation Office and local grassroots organisations connect them to befrienders who will reach out to them on a regular basis, providing companionship and encourage them to participate in social activities, keeping active and keeping connected with the local community. Seniors can also sign up with CareLine, which is a 24/7 social support hotline that provides tele-befriending services as well as emergency response to seniors in distress. While we do all this to build up the capabilities in our community partners, we will make sure that our main psychiatric sector, IMH, is updated. Since 2018, IMH has been undergoing refurbishment and improvement works to facilitate the care and improve operational efficiency and safety for patients and staff. And these works are expected to be completed by the end of 2022. Mr Chairman, to fight COVID-19 we have had to rely on the skill, dedication and professionalism of our people. We have had to develop and deploy technology and we have had to scale up clinical services, all the while looking after the many healthcare issues that are unrelated to the pandemic, but essential to our health. We have had to be agile, steadfast and determined. We are all a bit tired and fatigued, but also hopeful and confident that we can find our way forward. Our ability to get this far was the result of many years of investing in our people, our facilities, systems, research and capabilities. We must learn the lessons from this experience. The preparations for the next crisis, whatever it is, are underway and require that we keep ourselves and our healthcare system in good health. Prevention is best, preparation is also necessary.'], ['The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam)', \"Mr Chairman, we remain committed to our long-term priorities even as we focus on containing the pandemic. We continue to transform from Beyond Healthcare to Health, to support Singaporeans to lead healthier lifestyles and stay healthy in the “new normal”. It is important to take stock of our state of health. I am happy to report that Singapore ranked first globally for life expectancy at birth and healthy life expectancy at birth in the Global Burden of Diseases 2019 study. However, based on our National Population Health Survey 2020, there are still areas for improvement. While our smoking prevalence rates decreased to 10.1%, down from 13.9% in 2010, compared to 2017, the proportion of Singaporeans with sufficient total physical activity has dropped. The proportion of Singaporeans that are obese or overweight has increased. In 2019 and 2020, about two out of five are overweight. And the age-standardised prevalence of the three common chronic diseases, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol have risen and the prevalence of diabetes have not decreased. There is a need to better understand the current situation among different groups. Additionally, COVID-19 and the various measures and socio-economic challenges have impacted our lifestyles and our health. Dr Tan Yia Swam has also asked about supporting healthy living in this new norm. I will therefore share our plans to innovate health promotion efforts for Singaporeans to remain healthy in the “new normal” and how to better prepare Singaporeans to lead healthy lives for the future. Indeed, in the past year, Singaporeans faced challenges pursuing healthier habits in ways they were used to. With safe distancing concerns, we were unable to hold our usual health promotion programmes such as mass exercises. As working from home became the norm, we also observed a drop in physical activity time, likely from reduced commuting. This drop is also demonstrated in the daily average step count data from the Health Promotion Board’s (HPB) National Steps Challenge. We quickly pivoted to delivering our programmes virtually, in line with the safe management measures, or SMMs. We shifted physical activity programmes online, and produced exercise routines on YouTube and an edutainment series on free-to-air TV channels to help Singaporeans keep active. We understand that some seniors have found it challenging to adapt from physical to virtual modes of exercise. To help seniors navigate around these platforms, we worked with partners such as People’s Association to organise workshops to provide assistance, and equip them with basic IT skills. I am heartened to hear that our regular participants have benefitted. For example, for the senior-centric virtual Community Physical Activity Programmes, over 5,000 participated across more than 190 sessions from July to December 2020. To benefit as many as possible given the current guidelines, we will be scaling up our virtual programmes progressively this year. We understand that some still prefer physical interaction for health programmes. To reach out to more Singaporeans, we have gradually resumed physical sessions both in the community, such as our popular Sundays at the Park, and at the workplaces with the appropriate SMMs. Like physical health, mental wellbeing is also important for one’s health. I echo Senior Minister of State Janil on creating a supportive environment to empower Singaporeans to take care of their mental well-being. In August last year, we launched the “Brave the New” campaign with MCCY to build psychological resilience of individuals. The campaign provided tips for self-care, and information to support their peers and loved ones. It reached 2.1 million Singaporeans and three-quarters of those surveyed reported being more motivated to self-help or help others in their mental well-being. To complement this, the “Hi!JustCheckingIn” movement started in January this year to equip targeted segments of the population with the appropriate skills to help them identify and reach out to those who may need support. Building a supportive community is important, to encourage Singaporeans to seek help if they are unable to cope. Through our community partners, we included seniors in our mental well-being efforts. We understand that many seniors are mentally and physically affected during this pandemic, especially during the circuit breaker. Last year, we trialled the virtual “Balik Kampung” programme to link up 100 seniors over 22 Senior Activity Centres over activities to stay mentally stimulated. With good feedback on how it has helped seniors stay socially connected, we will ramp up these efforts. We will continue to promote holistic well-being. The HPB’s National Steps Challenge saw over 900,000 participants in its fifth season. The sixth season will start in the third quarter of this year and will augment the traditional Steps Challenge with a different dimension of well-being – sleep, via the first pilot Sleep Challenge. Having good sleep habits is key to good health and well-being. Through the Healthy365 application and a wearable, there will be nudges to achieve the recommended sleep duration, and tips on good sleep habits. Interested participants can look out for more details on Healthy365 and HealthHub. We will continue to work on avenues for Singaporeans to keep healthy while staying safe. We recognise that at different life stages, Singaporeans face different health needs, challenges and risks. Going forward, we will add a person-centric approach to address these across our population segments. Dr Tan Yia Swam has highlighted health literacy in her Budget debate speech and Dr Lim Wee Kiak has also suggested boosting our efforts with technology. We have embarked on initiatives similar to Dr Lim's vision. I am happy to update that the first digital version of My Health Booklet is ready on HealthHub, developed based on ground insights. This version provides an overview of your health screening records drawn from national health databases and smoking cessation messages for those motivated to quit smoking. We will add more features and health topics such as stress management and the nationally recommended vaccinations starting from July this year. Another example is LumiHealth, a free, two-year personalised health programme designed by HPB, in partnership with Apple, using the Apple Watch. Under this programme, participants will embark on customised health journeys and earn rewards as they complete health-related challenges. They will also receive personalised reminders, to encourage them to meet their goals. Since its launch in end-October 2020, we have seen more than 100,000 downloads. We must also not forget our efforts to keep chronic conditions at bay, like our on-going War on Diabetes. MOH developed the Patient Empowerment for Self-Care Framework to empower patients to co-own their care journeys and achieve better care outcomes with support from their healthcare team, family and friends. Under this framework, we developed the first tranche of the National Diabetes Reference Materials that provides fundamental information and hosted it online on HealthHub. We are now working on the next tranche of materials with more in-depth information to help patients, their family and friends, better understand and manage diabetes. This resource is being co-created by the people for the people – about 700 citizens highlighted additional topics and content that would be useful, and suggested design features for a more user-friendly online experience. These materials will be ready from 2022. Beyond our broad plans for our Singaporeans, I will elaborate on targeted efforts. Mr Leon Perera has highlighted the lower income groups. Minister Gan has shared how we ensure they have good access to affordable care. While our health promotion efforts remain inclusive to all, there are also efforts targeted to address their health needs, and we work across agencies to provide holistic support. One example is the Healthy Living Passport programme, which Mr Perera referred to. The programme is designed to improve health literacy and promote healthy lifestyles. It is customised based on the lifestyle needs of lower income families, with tailored messaging and education. This is a multi-agency effort, and will commence after the SMMs are reviewed. We aim to benefit 15,000 residents over three years. We intend to track changes in our participants' health literacy as well as their behavourial improvements. This would allow us to evaluate the impact of our programmes as we generally do with our efforts. We see significant disparities in health behaviours and outcomes across ethnicities and will be ramping up efforts in this area. For chronic diseases, in 2020, 14.4% of Malays and 14.2% of Indians have diabetes, compared to 8.2% for Chinese. Thirty-seven point five percent of Malays and 36.1% of Chinese have higher blood pressure, compared to 29.5% for Indians. For cancers, the Chinese consistently have the highest age-standardised cancer incidence rates, but the proportion of Malays among all cases of cancer has gradually increased over the decades. Looking upstream at other modifiable lifestyle risk factors, the Malays have the highest obesity rates and Indians have the highest prevalence of being overweight. The prevalence of daily smokers are more than twice as high amongst the Malays as compared to the Chinese and Indians. Research has shown, poor health behaviours can affect life expectancy. Therefore, our community needs to take stronger action, and support one another against poor health habits. Cultural preferences may influence health behaviours and we recognise the importance of engagement and collaboration with the different ethnic minority groups to design culturally relevant programmes. Some of our earlier efforts have seen good progress. For the Malay community, we have built our partnerships under HPB's Jaga Kesihatan, Jaga Ummah from 23 in 2018 to 32 mosque partners, and 18 other partners such as the Malay Executive Activity Committees (MAEC) and MENDAKI. With their support, we were able to provide a range of healthy living programmes for their congregants. Our Indian community partners such as Hindu Endowment Board, Sikh Welfare Council, SINDA and places of worship have provided strong support in engagement efforts with their networks. For example, NARPANI Pearavai provides Indian Activity Executive Committees funding to co-create health activities for their residents. Between 2018 and 2020, close to 15,000 Singapore Indian residents have participated in the various health promotion programmes. We will build on early successes to improve our work, to make healthy living a sustainable achievement. Moving forward, we will expand community partnerships and harness ground-up efforts to multiply our impact and and ensure that our programmes are culturally relevant through customisation. We will engage key community leaders through significant platforms to garner commitment towards health. For example, at a forum in end-March 2021, leaders from the Hindu Endowment Board, SINDA, NARPANI, Sikh Welfare Council and HPB will discuss the state of health amongst Indians and co-develop culturally relevant efforts to facilitate healthier lifestyles among Singaporean Indians. We look forward to an invigorating discussion and a year of fun, healthier activities for all Singapore Indian residents. Let me share further for the Malay community. Mr Chairman, allow me to say a few words in Malay, please.\"], ['The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam)', 'To bolster health-related efforts for the Malay community, we will form a new working group. I will be chairing this group together with Dr Wan Rizal and Ms Mariam Jaafar, as well as community bodies, such as M3 and the Muslim Healthcare Professionals Association (MPHA). We will continue to collaborate with the \"Jaga Kesihatan, Jaga Ummah\" (JKJU) network and community leaders to develop and implement health programmes throughout the year to foster good health habits. We will produce simple tips to remind the Malay community about the important steps to take care of their health. To sustain this effort on health, we will have Health Ambassadors and continue to enlarge this network of volunteers. Mdm Rahimah is one of our most committed Health Ambassadors since 2012. As a member of the Macpherson MAEC, she plans motivational health lectures for the Malay community. She also spends time teaching our seniors to surf the Internet. Mdm Rahimah’s efforts should be emulated. I would like to encourage all Singaporeans to follow her lead and contribute to the community.'], ['The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Ms Rahayu Mahzam)', \"Beyond ethnic minorities, I echo what Minister Masagos said on the importance of supporting our children and women to lead healthy lives for a healthier next generation. It is key to support couples who wish to start their own families. Mr Louis Ng asked about supporting couples undergoing IVF. Today, eligible Singaporean couples undergoing Assisted Conception Procedures, or ACP, in public Assisted Reproduction centres can receive co-funding support for the different procedures. The co-funding applies to each Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) cycle, and the patient would either receive the co-funding of 75% of the cost or the capped co-funding amount, whichever is lower. As such, there is no remaining balance to be rolled over. However, MOH regularly reviews the clinical evidence around the number of cycles to co-fund. At present, on average, women undergo two ART cycles before achieving pregnancy successfully. Evidence shows that the success rate of ART decreases with maternal age, as each successful cycle progresses. It is not just about Government funding, but the strain of couples to keep trying. Hence, we must continue to encourage couples to marry and start families early, to maximise the chances of conception. After co-funding, the current MediSave per-cycle limits are generally sufficient to cover the cost of a ACP cycle at public Assisted Reproduction Centres. As not all couples go through multiple cycles, we have allowed a higher MediSave withdrawal limit for the first two cycles so that more of the lifetime limit can be used. MediSave can be used to pay for all standard procedures for each method of treatment, such as the priming of the uterus, egg recovery and fertilisation processes. However, as Traditional Chinese Medicine treatments associated with IVF are not part of mainstream evidence-based treatment, there are no plans to allow MediSave for their use currently. MOH remains committed towards supporting Singaporean couples in their parenting journeys, and will continue to review the MediSave withdrawal limits to ensure they remain relevant and adequate for Singaporeans, as we balance immediate expenses with retaining sufficient savings for basic healthcare needs in old age. Apart from supporting couples, we enabled early intervention and enhanced subsidies for vaccinations under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule, or NCIS, for all Singaporean children at polyclinics, and extended them to CHAS GP clinics across Singapore in November 2020. We have also added vaccines against chicken pox, influenza and pneumococcal disease to the NCIS. For Singaporean children up to the age of six, we have extended full subsidies for childhood developmental screenings at CHAS GP clinics, to allow for early detection and timely intervention for any developmental delays. There is also support for their families. From last November, subsidies have been extended to vaccinations under the National Adult Immunisation Schedule, or NAIS, at CHAS GP clinics and polyclinics for all eligible Singaporean adults. Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked about the progress of our national immunisation efforts. Based on the National Population Health Survey 2020, the take-up rate is estimated to be 23% for influenza vaccination, and 14% for pneumococcal vaccination in persons aged 65 to 79 years of age. I am happy to update that three months after the enhancements, a total of 158,000 and 121,000 doses of the NAIS and NCIS vaccinations respectively have been administered nationally. In particular, for pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations that are recommended for the elderly aged 65 years or older, the uptake has been encouraging with more than 38,000 and 62,000 doses received respectively. One of the families that benefited is the Chiam family. The three-generational family has been regularly consulting Dr Lim Hong Shen from A Medical Clinic, under the NUHS Primary Care Network. With Dr Lim's strong support, their two children, aged two and four years old, have undergone their childhood developmental screenings and received subsidised vaccinations for influenza, as well as measles, mumps and rubella. The grandfather, aged 69 years old, has also received both the pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations. We hope that this improved accessibility and affordability will encourage Singaporeans to protect themselves and their families against vaccine-preventable diseases by getting vaccinated as recommended, and support children in starting off well and healthy. MOH is committed to increase the uptake of nationally recommended vaccinations, and will encourage eligible Singaporeans to be vaccinated. Together, we can encourage one another to take greater ownership of our health and lead healthier lives, for a better future.\"], ['Dr Tan Wu Meng', 'Thank you, Mr Chairman. By way of clarifications, I have one observation and one question. First, regarding the Senior Minister of State, Dr Janil\\'s observation that relooking healthcare needs to be through the lens of longer term issues in a COVID-19 world and looking at the larger social eco-system. I agree with this approach. It is essential in our approach to society and healthcare. I have a follow-up question for the Senior Minister of State, Dr Koh, regarding the earlier point in my speech on the approach to outsourcing hospital cleaners and hospital attendants. I do not expect an immediate resolution to this question, but I will urge a longer term rethink once the COVID-19 crisis is over. After all, COVID-19 has raised many questions of countries around the world. If it is supply chains, countries are looking, \"at just in time\" as compared to \"just in case\". And may I suggest that on issues of workforce, we also may want to look at economies of efficiency, but juxtaposing this and considering as well the resilience of solidarity across the entire healthcare team. And I hope MOH will consider this as part of a longer term review for the COVID-19 world, and what comes next.'], ['Dr Koh Poh Koon', 'Mr Chairman, I thank Dr Tan for his clarification. I would agree with him that as needs evolve over time, and certainly COVID-19 is a very challenging time, for us to also take stock post-COVID-19, what kind of healthcare model will we have, and in that case, to build resilience within maybe certain critical parts of our healthcare system; do we need to review the current structure in which we engage with outsourcing of our staff? So, I do not think we are ideological here but we will take an open-minded approach to review the needs and maybe talk to our healthcare institutions as well to see during this period, whether they have made useful insights and observations to warrant a change in the current approach. But I also must caution that in insourcing back certain levels of staff within the system, we need to make sure that there is still a meaningful career progression and prospects for them as well. Because if they are a small number, for which there is little career progression, we need to also bear that in mind to balance out the needs of the organisation versus the aspirations of the person.'], ['Dr Lim Wee Kiak', 'Thank you, Chairman. I have two clarifications. First, for the Parliamentary Secretary. Regarding the vaccination programme, I am happy to hear that a huge percentage of our seniors has been vaccinated for flu as well as for pneumococcal. The issue now is, of course, the outreach to the rest. There is currently now no specific outreach programme to reach out to seniors that have not been vaccinated. So, I hope that MOH can review this and then take a look. When I take a look at the HealthHub apps, there is immunisation charge based on age, but the age stops at 26 years old. Beyond that, there is nothing. So, can MOH take a look at it to see how to expand that further. My second clarification goes to the Senior Minister of State Janil. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State on a hypothetical question: if COVID-19 outbreak were to happen in Singapore, in the sense, let us say it happened in November 2019, could our current system or our NCID have picked up the unusual presentation of pneumonia, and could we have the capability to diagnose such a novel virus? Looking back, do we have the ability to do so?'], ['Ms Rahayu Mahzam', 'I thank the Member for the clarification question. Thank you for highlighting the issue with regard to the HealthHub age cut-off. We are, indeed, still developing the platform and we will be adding more information. So, I will bring this back and then we will develop it further. In response to the query on the outreach for vaccination, especially the seniors, actually HPB has recently launched a public education campaign to encourage eligible individuals to get vaccinated, and getting them to increase their awareness. The key thing about vaccination is getting them to be aware of it. So, we did try to roll out a public education campaign and this is something that we can build on. The other thing is to work with the General Practitioners (GPs), with the doctors, to get them to routinely advise their patients on vaccination needs, especially every time they come to visit, we would ask them to inform their patients, so that this will also increase awareness and their interest and uptake for vaccination.'], ['Dr Janil Puthucheary', \"Thank you, Mr Chairman. If I understand the Member's questions correctly, if an outbreak had occurred now? With the capability we had then or the capability we have now?\"], ['Dr Lim Wee Kiak', 'In October 2019.'], ['Dr Janil Puthucheary', \"So, with the capability that we had in October 2019, would we have picked up COVID-19 outbreak in October 2019? The short answer is yes. We pick up outbreaks of disease on a regular basis. Our level of paranoia, anxiety, concern about this increased after SARS, as a result of which clinical teams across the healthcare network have to report any number of either confirmed or suspected infectious diseases. And we have surveillance systems. So, the real answer is not really whether we would have picked it up, but how quickly would we have picked it up and how quickly would we have responded and put in place many of these strategies that we now see as normal for containing disease outbreak. Whether it is the testing, the tracing, speed of that, the ability to quarantine individuals, the ability to do the sequencing and stand up therapeutics. So, certainly, our capabilities have improved and increased quite significantly since the first outbreak. So, the short answer to the Member's question is yes but we can do it much better today. One of the reasons why we can do it much better today is because this is not SARS. We have learned the lessons from SARS, we have learned the lessons from COVID-19, and we have to prepare that Disease X, the next pandemic and the next crisis, will be like neither. And we need that institutional agility and institutional capability to deal with the unknown, which is one of the more difficult things that we have to do. I hope that answers the Member's question.\"], ['Mr Leong Mun Wai', 'Thank you, Chairman. I have two clarifications. One is I think the Ministers and the Senior Ministers of State did not answer my query on how the public health services are being priced, whether it is based on marginal cost or average cost. Maybe I add a bit more information on that, specifically about whether it is based on amortisation of assets, land cost, rental cost, all these – I hope to be clarified. Second question is on MediShield Life insurance scheme. I am actually still very puzzled why our healthcare insurance schemes are left open-ended. Because as one gets older, as Singaporeans get older, they will find it more and more unaffordable. I have also spoken in my speech that when Singaporeans get older like 80 years old or 90 years old, the premium will become very high. For example, under two scenarios, when you keep the premium —'], ['Mr Leong Mun Wai', 'Okay. I would like to ask for clarifications that the MediShield Life Scheme indeed is unaffordable, as one gets older, and there is a drain on the CPF resources on the Singaporean And that is a very high number, up to $110,000 for a family. So, those are the questions I would like further clarification on. Because these are very important; has to be answered.'], ['Dr Koh Poh Koon', 'Mr Chairman, I will attempt to explain the MediShield Life premium issue. I have actually done an extensive explanation when I gave an update to this House late last year. I think the answer still applies. Mr Leong should check the Hansard. I think his point that the MediShield Life premium is unaffordable, the older the Singaporean gets, is not correct. Because if he checks my speech in the Hansard, he would have understood the fact that, for the Pioneer Generation, who are the older Singaporeans in Singapore, they get MediSave top-ups to pay for their premiums. In fact, for many of the oldest in the Pioneer Generation, they get virtually free MediShield Life because they virtually pay no premium at all. So, I do not think he understood what was said in the House last year and I urge him to read my speech all over again in Hansard.'], ['Ms Carrie Tan', 'Thank you, Chairman. My question is related to mental health. I thank the Senior Minister of State Dr Janil for sharing with us about the tremendous progress made in the Mental Health Master Plan, and to know that there is so much more infrastructure and community care facilities set up and that we are already ahead of targets. But my question really is whether MOH has a view or is it currently embarking on any kind of study or upstream prevention campaigns, in the likes of when we identified diabetes to be a big healthcare crisis for Singapore, then we went on a very national campaign and we looked into reducing sugar and salt in our food in the hawker centre and so on. I remember when I was a child in Primary School, I was also in the Trim and Fit (TAF) Club to address obesity.'], ['Ms Carrie Tan', 'Yes. My question is: does MOH have a view or intention to study how we can embark on a prevention strategy to avoid this continuing trend of high incidence of mental health or mental illness amongst our population in the long run?'], ['Dr Janil Puthucheary', 'Mr Chairman, the answer is yes. It is not just MOH that is interested in this. This is an area where the academics and the professionals working with people with mental health issues are very interested in looking at. This is not going to be an area that we can have complete prevention. We also have to research into areas about how we can help people cope and mitigate the mental health issues that they come across. It is not going to be easy to pinpoint a single factor, just like diabetes. While we can concentrate our efforts on sugar or weight loss activity, we will have a variety of things to direct attention and the efforts of the individual in the family. But the reality is it is a wide space with many different causes and many different paths through it, and it will be something that requires effort from a multi-disciplinary team and, indeed, the whole of society. But the short answer is yes, we are very interested in this.'], ['Mr Gan Kim Yong', 'Thank you, Mr Chairman. Let me just add on to what Senior Minister of State Janil has explained. Mental wellness is quite a complex issue. And, very often, is not just a medical issue. Therefore, very often, when we want to address challenges of mental well-being, it will have to go beyond MOH. That is why we are forming a multi-agency platform to allow the various agencies including MSF, and including MOM to look at the workplace mental well-being; and including MOE to start from young. So, it is a multi-pronged approach and it requires a whole-of-society involvement in this, particularly in preventive mental health. Because it requires a lot of support in the community to work with us, work with various Ministries and agencies, so that, together, we can better address the challenges of mental well-being and help our Singaporeans, particularly, the young, to be better prepared for the challenges that they are going to see, so that we can strengthen their resilience against mental challenges.'], ['Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song', \"Sir, I have some clarifications for Senior Minister of State Koh. First, can I confirm the Ministry's definition of PCHI is based on family members living under the same roof? Second, what is the Ministry's main concern about allowing greater use of MediSave in polyclinics, SOCs and restructured hospitals? I know MOH is worried about premature depletion of the MediSave accounts. However, MediSave can only be used for medically necessary treatments, and the risk of doctors in these public institutions over-treating is minimal. And patients there also have little discretion to demand unnecessary treatment. On the flip side, patients do retain their discretion to skip treatment to reduce out-of-pocket payments. This will impact the success of their treatment that may cause both the patient and the Government more in the long term. Can MOH reconsider how prudent it still is to restrict the use of MediSave in these public healthcare institutions?\"], ['Dr Koh Poh Koon', 'Mr Chairman, I thank the Member for asking the clarifications. Yes, indeed, for PCHI, it is based on residents with the same household address, so that we know that they are staying in close proximity and they can mutually support each other. In terms of MediSave usage for mutual support, in fact, you can designate a next-of-kin, for example, You can have your spouse or even the children, who may not necessarily be staying at the same address, can also add support with their MediSave to contribute to the care of their aged parents, who may not reside in the same address but they can use the MediSave from their children, and vice versa. In terms of liberalising MediSave usage, we have through the years, allowed more and more uses for MediSave. You will remember that when we first started with the Chronic Disease Management (CDMP), there were only a few conditions that were in it. In the last few years, more and more conditions were added with considerations such as disease prevalence, whether they are effective treatment and whether there is clear treatment protocol, that can translate to a good outcome. We are open to review the list of diseases that will be added on overtime as the science and the medical understanding develops as well, and in consultation with a panel of medical experts who can advise us on what they feel is useful to include in the CDMP list. We are always opening further opportunity to use MediSave, and as the Member pointed out, they could well be situations in which we could liberalise some more and we will continue to do so.'], ['Mr Yip Hon Weng', 'Thank you, Chairman. I am glad to hear from Minister Masagoes that the Ministry is reviewing the Senior Mobility and Enabling Fund. Can the Ministry provide more details about the focus area of review and when will the review be completed?'], ['Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M', 'I thank the Member for clarification. We will begin the review this year. Hopefully, by the second half but we do not know yet the scope nor the time that this will complete.'], ['Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang', 'Thank you, Sir. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary on the reply on the IVF policies. There is quite a fair bit of good suggestions out there on IVF and that is why I filed so many cuts, Parliamentary Questions and Adjournment Motion. Could I ask whether MOH can consider setting up a citizen workgroup to really deep dive into this issue of IVF here in Singapore?'], ['Ms Rahayu Mahzam', 'I thank Member for the suggestion. I am sure that this is something we can consider and I will follow up with the Member after the Budget and Committee of Supply debates are over.'], ['Mr Leong Mun Wai', 'Chairman, excuse me, Chairman. My clarification on the pricing of the public health services has not been answered.'], ['Mr Gan Kim Yong', \"Perhaps I can just give a very quick answer. First, we take into account all the costs that healthcare institutions incurred, because someone has to pay for these costs – whether it is the Government, whether it is the patient, whether it is the institution. So, we have to cost them fully. Having costed them fully, the Government then provides subvention to cover the bulk of the cost of operation and the cost of investment in the building of the infrastructure. On top of that, we provide subvention for the patients when they go and see the doctors or they receive treatment at these healthcare institutions. So, yes, we account for the cost of the building and the delivery of services. But at the same time, we provide subvention and subsidies for the patients and for the institutions' operations.\"], ['Dr Tan Wu Meng', 'Mr Chairman, I thank all Members for their cuts and I thank our Ministers, Senior Ministers of State, Parliamentary Secretary at MOH for their responses and sharing. The COVID-19 virus does not sleep. It does not rest and so are our healthcare frontliners, our agencies, our MOH officials have also had many sleepless nights because of this COVID-19 pandemic. Presumably, with implications for sleep health as Parliamentary Secretary shared earlier. So, a big thank you to all who keep us safe, and in doing so, keep Singapore going.
