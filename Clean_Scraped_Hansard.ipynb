    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook reads the raw text data from Hansard scrapings and combines it with MP data stored in CSV format, to produce a CSV file of the various parliamentary questions contained within the scrapings, as well as their askers and other relevant info. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the two scraping notebooks first. The Hansard scraper gives you a directory of HTML files while the MP scraper gives you a CSV file. Then run this notebook to get another CSV file, `pqs.csv`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Hansard data is a terrible mess. This code has to deal with the weird edge cases in the Hansard dataset so it is also a terrible mess. I left some comments describing some of these edge cases; you can ctrl+F for \"edge case\" to find them. The relevant file names of the HTML files which contain the edge cases are provided too. If you want to view the original pages in all their glory, you can perform the following steps: \n",
    "1. Take the file name and replace the first `_` with `?`\n",
    "2. Remove the `.html` suffix\n",
    "3. Prepend `https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/`\n",
    "4. Then head to the URL that you get.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `sprs3topic_reportid=budget-1904.html` becomes [https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/sprs3topic?reportid=budget-1904](https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/sprs3topic?reportid=budget-1904).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: the CSV file you get from this is delimited by `|`. If reading the CSV file with pandas, make sure you set the `sep` argument to account for this. If opening in Excel, follow the steps [here](https://support.affinity.co/hc/en-us/articles/360044453711-How-to-open-CSV-files-with-the-correct-delimiter-separator).**\n",
